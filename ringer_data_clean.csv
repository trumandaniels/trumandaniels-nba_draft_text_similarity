0,18.7,1.0,2020,77.0,KILLIAN HAYES,"Left-hand dominant: He might as well tie his right hand behind his back considering how little he uses it—there are some passes he can’t make since he relies on his left hand so much. Limited athlete who lacks burst and bounce, which hinders his finishing ability, especially since he rarely uses his right hand. Lacks an advanced handle. Picks up his dribble too often, which gets him into trouble. He’s shifty but doesn’t create a ton of separation and doesn’t string together advanced moves to break down defenses. Experiences lapses on defense, missing rotations and falling out of his on-ball stance. He needs to be more vocal as a lead guard to take better command of the team.",Guard,"Playmaking is his best skill. He can whip passes off the dribble with accuracy and hit cutters or rollers with precision. Creative pick-and-roll facilitator. Despite his weak right hand, he gets where he wants and knows how to manipulate defenses to create passing angles and openings to score. Fluid ball handler with the size to outmuscle smaller guards. Excellent touch with his left hand finishing difficult floaters and runners, often after initiating contact. Displays major potential as an off-the-dribble 3-point shooter with Hardenesque moves. Added a stepback and sidestep 3 to his arsenal and uses hesitations to get into pull-ups. His catch-and-shoot shooting numbers are concerning, but he has smooth form, a soft touch inside, and a free throw percentage over 80—all of which suggest he’ll figure it out. Tall, with a strong frame and long arms, making him a projectably versatile defender against guards and wings. Active off-ball menace who could develop into a disruptive defensive helper.", Ulm / France,NaN,215,80.25,NaN,,
1,18.6,2.0,2020,79.0,LAMELO BALL,"Ball is a great passer, but he can’t be classified as a great playmaker yet because of his decision-making. He jacks up poor shots early in the clock and settles far too often rather than attacking the rim. Poor shooting mechanics: He has no consistency with his form, other than his low release. As a solid free throw shooter with good touch on floaters, he has obvious upside. But his form—much like his brother’s—must be overhauled. Rarely initiates contact and avoids it around the rim. He doesn’t stay in his defensive stance and often keeps his hands down when closing out—or as Mark Jackson would say: “Hand down, man down.” Defensive discipline: He defaults to switching instead of fighting over screens and he falls out of position off-ball when chasing steals.",Guard,"Ambidextrous passer with pinpoint accuracy and omnidirectional vision. He sees everything on the court, creating opportunities for teammates that most players simply don’t see or can’t pull off thanks to his innate ability to manipulate defenders. Excellent ball handler who uses hesitations to put defenders on skates. He uses advanced moves but always remains in control, dictating the pace like a drummer would a song’s tempo. Elite touch. Though he attempts too many floaters and shys away from contact, his ability to score creatively with either hand suggests he could develop into a finisher at the rim. Attentive off-ball player who cuts and adjusts to space well behind the arc. Great rebounder for his position like his older brother Lonzo. His instincts pop up here when tracking down boards. Versatile defender. He’s quick laterally and quite large for a point guard. He has the size to comfortably switch onto wings.", Illawarra Hawks,NaN,190,82.0,NaN,,
2,18.7,3.0,2020,77.0,ANTHONY EDWARDS,"Not a pure shooter; he settles for jumpers even against mismatches, which is especially frustrating for a player with his size and strength. Best suited to be in a multiple-ball-handler system next to a pass-first player because of his underwhelming playmaking instincts. Inconsistent effort. At times he plays hard by cutting, running up the floor, and crashing the boards. But then he’ll disappear—teams will need to do extensive background to gauge his mentality. Despite his athleticism, he struggles as an off-ball defender, lacking focus and often losing track of his man. Fundamentals and effort must improve while defending on-ball; lockdown flashes are mired by far too many moments of apathy.",Guard,"Powerful driving to the rim; when he initiates contact, defenders bounce off him. Finishes with athleticism and displays soft touch with either hand. Dynamic shot-maker off the dribble; he fluidly transitions from complex dribbles, spins, and hesitations into pull-ups, stepbacks, and side steps. A freight train in transition; though his shot selection was iffy at Georgia, wide-open spacing in the NBA could lead to far more shots at the rim. Solid passer. Doesn’t possess elite court vision, and tends to react rather than create opportunities for teammates, but he can execute basic reads to shooters and cutters. Potentially a super-versatile defender thanks to his rare blend of size, strength, and agility.", Georgia,freshman,225,81.0,NaN,,
3,20.1,4.0,2020,77.0,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Lack of athleticism and burst limits his upside as a primary shot creator. Generally avoids contact at the rim, which forces him to settle for tough layups or low-percentage floaters. Made progress off the dribble as a sophomore, but still didn’t shoot well, and his stiff form raises concern. Man-to-man defense: He stands in too much of an upright stance and moves laterally on his heels. Also takes poor angles fighting around screens.",Guard,"Always in control; he lacks lightning speed or explosiveness, but he uses subtle gear changes to throw defenders off balance, create room, and then strike. Takes long strides on drives to the rim and displays good timing when gathering his dribble before using his length to score at the rim. Creative playmaker with extraordinary vision and ambidextrous handles to deliver passes at all angles; he manipulates defenders with his eyes and dribble in the pick-and-roll, and has pinpoint accuracy on passes to rollers and shooters. Good spot-up shooter with deep NBA range, despite his odd form. A coach’s dream: He does all the little things on the court, from smart, timely defensive rotations to making rapid decisions to keep the offense flowing.", Iowa State,sophomore,175,84.0,NaN,,
4,19.6,6.0,2020,79.0,DEVIN VASSELL,"Lacks burst to beat defenders off the dribble and get to the rim—and even if he gets to the paint, he struggles to finish against contact. Wiry frame may limit his versatility against larger, stronger opponents.",Wing,"Elite team defender who will immediately help any NBA rotation. He is hyper-alert on rotations, disrupts opponents’ actions with timely digs, and deters shooters from firing with fundamental closeouts. Never stops hustling. Even when a play seems over, he’ll fly out of nowhere for a chase-down block or last-second deflection. Impactful on-ball defender with the right blend of agility and length to defend guards and wings, though he must get stronger. Good spot-up shooter with a high release and displays awareness moving and cutting off the ball. Tightened his handle to become a potent shooter off the bounce; he hit a single dribble jumper as a freshman and then 39 as a sophomore, with many of them contested out of the pick-and-roll. Displays high-level passing vision for a wing, though he’s not a primary ball handler.", Florida State,sophomore,194,82.0,NaN,,
5,19.0,7.0,2020,85.0,JAMES WISEMAN,"Poor shot selection in high school; he played like he thought he was the second coming of Dirk Nowitzki. In college, he played more to his strengths, which needs to continue at the NBA level; the context of his situation will be key to his success. He’s an all-world athlete in an open gym, but he slows down in games when he has to read the floor. Simplifying his role will be vital early on. He has a weak handle, which limits him off the dribble. And as a playmaker, he misses open cutters and delivers inaccurate passes. He’s best suited to finish rather than create. Chases too many blocks and ends up falling for pump fakes. Sluggish lateral movement on the perimeter due to a lack of quickness and shoddy footwork. Defenders blow by him too often. At this stage, he’s not switchable.",Big,"Elite measurables with long arms and a strong frame. He runs the floor like a gazelle, and he explodes vertically when he has space to launch. Active rebounder. He displays a high motor and great instincts tracking the trajectory of missed shots on the offensive glass. His best offensive role is as a screener who rolls hard to the rim since he can finish lobs or with touch. But he can also mix in pops to generate shots from the perimeter and keep defenses honest. Strong post-up potential. Displays a rare blend of power and finesse and does a nice job of sealing off his man. But he currently lacks advanced power moves, instead defaulting to fadeaways. Shooting upside: He has good mechanics and soft touch. But he lacks range and doesn’t have a track record of success shooting from midrange and 3. Athletic rim protector whose mere presence can deter opponents. He’s good at assessing what’s in front of him. If his positioning and court awareness improves, he has elite potential. High-character person who works hard on and off the court. He’s intelligent, too; These are positive personality traits that could aid his development.", Memphis,freshman,237,90.0,NaN,,
6,19.5,8.0,2020,74.0,TYRELL TERRY,"Developing a stepback and side-dribble 3 is the next step for him. At this stage, the far majority of his dribble-jumper 3s are pull-ups. When he takes wild shots—which were often necessary at Stanford—his mechanics often fall apart; he kicks his legs out and lands wide instead of releasing with sound fundamentals. He needs to improve his off-hand to score better around the rim against length and contact. Picks up his dribble too often on drives to the rim. He should keep it alive and learn how to circle through the lane or look for the open man. Goes through the motions at times as a playmaker. He needs to put zip on the ball.",Guard,"Elite shooter with a quick, high release. He can run off screens and find his balance midair (48 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s), or unload off-the-dribble jumpers from deep behind the arc (32 percent). Advanced off-ball movement: He manipulates defenders with pivots and fakes to get himself open. The Curry family would be proud of his tendency to relocate for corner 3s after giving up the ball. Crafty interior finisher with an expansive layup package. He has a keen sense for how to contort his body on layup attempts, and the soft touch to score from awkward angles or against contact. Makes an impact in the pick-and-roll. He has the burst to turn the corner and generally makes smart decisions when deciding whether to shoot or pass. Solid passer who can make fundamental plays, plus the more advanced ones like whips to 3-point shooters and wrap-arounds to rolling bigs. Competitive defender who will take a charge and dive for loose balls. On switches, he’ll try to battle against bigger players.", Stanford,freshman,160,NaN,NaN,,
7,19.4,9.0,2020,75.0,TYRESE MAXEY,"Lacks top-end quickness and acceleration. He’s at his best playing off others, but he’ll need to improve his handle to be a reliable scorer. Attempts a lot of tough, contested shots due to his inability to generate space off the dribble. Low release may contribute to his streakiness as a shooter. He has good overall form but has some really inaccurate misses that occasionally clank off the glass.",Guard,"Clever finisher at the rim who can score from awkward angles using the glass and absorb contact to find an angle using either hand. Shot only 32 percent on jumpers, but his compact form, soft touch, and high percentage from the line bodes well for his future as a shooter. Comfortable shooting off the dribble in either direction. He lacks elite burst but he makes rapid movements stopping and transitioning into his shot. Good pick-and-roll scorer who can get to the rim or pull up and shoot. Excellent on-ball defender with a strong frame and long arms. He plays hard, shifts his feet, and flips his hips to move well laterally and defend pick-and-rolls. He’s strong enough to power through screens or defend larger wings. Off-ball defense: Stays engaged, rotates well, and anticipates where the ball will be to beat opponents to their spots.", Kentucky,freshman,198,78.0,NaN,,
8,19.2,10.0,2020,78.0,ISAAC OKORO,"Stiff shooter with clunky mechanics—defenses already sag off him. He brings the ball to his shot pocket too soon, ruining the timing of his release. Nonfactor off the dribble. Subpar free throw shooter, which doesn’t provide much optimism for the development of his jumper.",Wing,"Great finisher who delivers through contact, draws fouls, and displays a pillowy touch with either hand. Smart decision-maker who moves the ball, can run some pick-and-roll, and doesn’t force bad shots—instead of taking a contested runner, he’ll almost always kick it out to an open shooter. Displays a good handle with either hand on crossovers, spins, and hesitations. He could have untapped, long-term upside as a shot creator. Versatile on-ball defender with the strength to battle bigger players, and the ideal blend of fundamentals, quickness, and intelligence to play on the perimeter.

9,22.1,11.0,2020,81.0,OBI TOPPIN,"Brutal pick-and-roll defender who displays little recognition or feel for reading a screen; he’s almost always out of position. High center of gravity limits his defensive ability in the post. He’ll often get pushed around for low-post positioning—Zion would bury him under the rim. Doesn’t change directions well laterally; he has tight hips, which means NBA offenses will attack him relentlessly one-on-one. Poor help defender and rebounder who doesn’t play with great awareness or effort.",Big,"Glides through the air for ferocious dunks; he’s a major threat in the pick-and-roll, cutting, and running the break. He also possesses a soft touch with either hand around the rim. Nimble ball handler who can attack from the perimeter; he’ll be a weapon in fake dribble handoffs since he can facilitate, shoot, or get to the basket. Good shooter from NBA 3-point range, but he hasn’t fallen in love with his shot like many modern bigs. Strong playmaker. He makes quick decisions out of the short roll and could develop into a playmaking hub from the post. Has the leaping ability and quickness to theoretically be an effective shot blocker.", Dayton,NaN,220,83.0,NaN,,
10,19.9,12.0,2020,75.0,COLE ANTHONY,"Shot selection: He forces too many contested looks instead of looking to pass, which causes bouts with streakiness. Not a pure playmaker, nor does he naturally make his teammates better. He needs to work on making advanced reads, but even on the simple passes his accuracy is underwhelming. Defensive versatility: He plays hard and smart, but he’s still undersized and likely to be targeted by opponents on switches or against elite guards.",Guard,"Talented shooter. He knows how to relocate off-ball, balance himself midair, and drain off-the-catch 3s. Constant threat to score thanks to his ability to hit stepbacks and pull-ups from all over the floor. Ambidextrous finisher with hops, body control, strength, and touch; he’s much better than his numbers indicate because of North Carolina’s horrific spacing in the half court, often with two nonshooting bigs on the floor. Dynamic ball handler who could thrive with more room as a pick-and-roll threat. He strings together combo moves, showing off a mix of change-of-pace dribbles with crosses using either hand. He looks to score first, but can make basic passes. Dangerous transition threat. He’s an excellent defensive rebounder, and he can provide a jolt by sprinting down the floor on the break. Feisty on-ball defender who has a sturdy frame and excellent lateral movement. Impactful off-ball defender who keeps his head on a swivel and makes timely, fundamental rotations and occasionally flies in for weak-side blocks.", North Carolina,freshman,190,76.5,NaN,,
11,19.2,13.0,2020,77.0,RJ HAMPTON,"Inconsistent footwork hurts his jump shot. His feet always seem to be lined up differently, though they’re generally too close for him to cleanly release his shot. His upper body looks good, though. Without a reliable jumper, his strengths will be diminished. Selecting him is a big bet on the development of his shooting ability. Though his at-rim finishing is an overall positive, he must get stronger so he can absorb contact better and not overly rely on crafty finishes. He’s a raw playmaker still figuring out how to make his teammates better. He makes some bad reads and occasionally forces passes.",Guard,"He can hit turbo on drives to the rim, and has explosiveness when elevating for layups. He stays low on crossovers, and displays advanced moves with herky-jerky hesitations. Displays the fundamentals, craft, and body control to become a good interior finisher. Playmaking potential. Loves one-handed whip passes off the dribble, and throws them with precision. Doesn’t make advanced reads but flashes the ability to develop in pick-and-roll. Good off-ball player: He’s an aware cutter, relocates well around the perimeter, and runs like Forrest Gump in transition. Gotta love the hustle. Long-term defensive upside because of his athleticism.", New Zealand Breakers,NaN,188,79.0,NaN,,
12,19.3,14.0,2020,81.0,DENI AVDIJA,"Worrisome shooting: He has solid form but has posted poor percentages from the floor and the line. Off the catch, he tends to pause as he adjusts the ball in his hands. He’s streaky, but he also may just lack touch. Doesn’t have top-end burst or springs, so he’ll really need to master his ball handling to maximize his ability to create space and shots. He’s an active on-ball defender but lacks the lateral quickness to contain quicker players. He works hard, though, and NBA conditioning programs should help. Lacks the length to be an effective rim protector—both as a small-ball big and as a help defender in traditional lineups.",Wing,"Great playmaker for his position. He’s savvy in the pick-and-roll, rarely makes mistakes, and attentively locates cutters and shooters. He keeps the ball moving in the half court and pushes the ball ahead on the break. Solid ball handler. At 6-foot-9, he doesn’t have much shake, but he knows how to change speeds with enough aptitude to clear room for his passes. His best role could be as a playmaking hub from the post and on the short roll due to the combination of his height and passing ability. Strong finisher who can use either hand and scores through contact. Loves to pump-fake. He’ll fearlessly drive into the paint and challenge rim protectors. Excellent team defender who rotates well and typically finds himself in the right position. He’s not an athletic player, but can make an impact with his positioning as a reliable help defender.

Skilled shooter off screens who takes tight routes, makes smart reads, and has elite fundamentals from catch to release. Comfortable shooting 3s off the dribble. He has a nice side step and stepback 3 with clean footwork. Straight-line driver who is decisive attacking closeouts. With his size and strength, he could develop into a good finisher. Understands his role and excels within it. He’s a great screener, executes plays, takes smart shots, and keeps the ball moving. Competitive on-ball defender; with some improved fundamentals and athleticism, he could become far more versatile. Intelligent defender.

Needs to improve shooting off the dribble, especially when going right. He also lacks a reliable floater.

Not a switchable defender due to his size: He’s incredibly light, and lacks a frame to support much more weight.",Guard,"Dynamic shot creator who blends speed, acceleration, and body control with quality crossovers and hesitations to find high-percentage shots. Pick-and-roll playmaking habits bode well for his potential. He does a great job getting into the paint and then whipping the ball to perimeter shooters. Smooth stroke with bouts of streakiness, but his form, free throw percentage, and shot selection are all positive long-term indicators.

Despite a knack for playmaking, he got called for countless travels due to raw footwork and forced drives into traffic.",Wing,"Efficient at-rim scorer who uses either hand on athletic extended finishes. Talented scorer off the dribble who can rise—and sometimes hang —before draining tough, contested jumpers. Sound decision-maker who plays within the system.

He loves to use hesitations, especially in the pick-and-roll, and he can deliver accurate passes off the dribble. Does the little things like cutting, screening, and rebounding. With his size and skill, it’s projectable for a team to use him like a big as an on-ball screener who can pop for 3s or dive to the rim. Smart, athletic team defender who communicates and disrupts actions with timely help defense. Gritty player who hustles hard on defense. He’s had a handful of inspired chasedown blocks.

It is vital that he finds an excellent strength-and-conditioning program. Inconsistent defensive effort. He plays like he’s 6 feet sometimes, not even bothering to contest shots with his long wingspan. Tries to do too much on offense. He forces tough shots and tries ill-advised moves rather than making the sensible play. Doesn’t hold his follow-through on jumpers, which is one of the reasons for his streakiness; better fundamentals will lead to better results.",Big,"Versatile shooting potential: He has good footwork and body control, with a compact release coming off screens and off the dribble; he can rise and fire even with a hand in his face.

He has good handles for his size, using hesitations, crossovers, and long strides to create separation. His movements are also decisive; there are very few record scratches when he possesses the ball. It’s easy to envision an offensive role for him as a floor spacer and secondary handler in the half court, and as a transition playmaker who rips down rebounds and jump-starts possessions.

Savvy pick-and-roll presence thanks to his change-of-pace play. He can pull up or split defenders to get into the paint. Instinctual passer with a high IQ; he makes rapid decisions facilitating. He weaponizes his shooting ability to create passing lanes, and loves to attack the baseline before wrapping around passes to bigs. Dynamic player in transition. He can race ahead of the defense for 3s and loud open-floor finishes, or handle the ball and facilitate scoring chances.

Plays too fast for his own good at times, driving into the lane and tossing up wild shots or passes.",Guard,"Manufactures baskets even against a set defense because of his tight handle and speed. He has advanced moves and a quick first step, and accelerates in a flash. Excellent driving to the rim; he’s fearless and draws a ton of fouls. Can generate space or contact with advanced footwork and an array of moves. Ambidextrous finisher and explosive jumper who knows how to use his body to shield off defenders. Shot 81 percent on 300-plus attempts from the free throw line, which bodes well for his long-term 3-point shooting ability if he improves his form. Constantly improving as a playmaker; he’s learned how to draw defenders in to create open looks for teammates. He’s not a passing savant, but he does his job well and limits mistakes. Feisty defender who plays bigger than his 6-foot-3 wingspan would suggest. With a strong frame, he can at least battle and mirror opponents laterally.", Kansas,sophomore,185,75.25,NaN,,

Doesn’t establish deep seals to get ideal post positioning due to his weak lower-body strength. Subpar passer. He panics when pressured, especially on the post. Even when he has space, he telegraphs passes like a quarterback staring down his receiver. Lacks agility changing directions, which especially hurts him on defense. Even if he recognizes a play, he can be a beat late.",Big,"Talented shooter with sound mechanics. He excels off screens and handoffs. His size and position make him even more valuable. Dynamic screening threat: He sets strong, fundamental picks, and forces defenses to respect his ability to dive to the rim or pop out for a 3. Good interior finisher with either hand. He has touch, and he can finish with power, especially on putbacks when crashing the boards. Runs the floor hard. He’ll beat defenses for dunks and layups, but he can also trail and drain 3s. High-motor, high-IQ defender. Solid shot blocker with a savvy sense of timing. Boxes out on the boards and rebounds well.", Maryland,sophomore,225,85.5,NaN,,
26,19.6,28.0,2020,79.0,LEANDRO BOLMARO,"He needs to improve his off-hand to compensate for the fact that he’s a below-the-rim finisher who struggles against length.

There are some quirks in his jumper, especially in his wrist, that need to be ironed out.",Guard,"He can make every pass in the book using either hand. He sees passing lanes that few others can, and makes the reads so quickly that it’s as if he’s two steps ahead. Slick ball handler who gets where he wants on the floor with his change-of-pace moves and tempo despite a lack of elite athleticism. Good touch on floaters, runners, and layups, which bodes well long term for his subpar jump shot. Intelligent off-ball player who cuts and relocates like a veteran.

If his 3-point progress is for real, he’ll also be able to stretch defenses. Displays potential as a spot-up shooter. He has some funky mechanics, but they’ve gotten him this far. He has good touch from the line too. Excellent off-ball defender who communicates well and keeps his head on a swivel. He’s fearless, too; he’ll contest shots even if he risks being put on a poster. Typically, he’ll alter or block shots with his verticality and length. High-level on-ball defender. Quick laterally and can also switch on screens.

Despite unorthodox mechanics, he shot 43 percent from 3 and 80 percent from the line in four years at TCU. Comfortable shooting off the dribble. He won’t be an iso threat in the pros, but can attack a mismatch or pull-up to punish a scrambling defense. Excels at pick-and-roll decision-making, playing with pace and delivering accurate passes all over the court. Solid finisher who can use either hand around the rim. He has touch, which is vital since he lacks hops. Decisive player who reads the floor at a high level. He cuts and relocates well and facilitates effectively and intentionally.

Also needs to kick his strange habit of jab-stepping before he shoots. Developing a jumper off the dribble is the key to unlocking his full potential; he shoots the ball flat and looks uncomfortable even from the elbow. Must learn how to change gears to minimize sloppy passes or out-of-control drives that lead to charges. He can be predictable: He overuses the drop step on post-ups, and he rarely uses his right hand on shots near the rim. He needs a more diverse arsenal of moves on drives and post-ups. Defensive awareness could use fine-tuning; often falls into upright stance, ball-watches, and misses help rotations. Defensive discipline is lacking; though he makes explosive plays, savvy opponents will throw moves that make him leave his feet, or crash the boards when he overhelps. With his size and explosiveness, health is always a question: He suffered a right foot bruise in high school that put him in a walking boot, sprained his MCL at Duke, and has been out of shape in the past.",Big,"Capable of running pick-and-roll as a ball handler; the team that drafts him can use him in virtually any role on offense. A potential five-position defender with a rare combination of strength, agility, and anticipation skills; he can comfortably switch on-ball screens. Zion’s explosive jukes and hop-steps are glitches in the laws of physics; a player his size shouldn’t be able to create separation the way he does. A wrecking-ball finisher who can finish through and above contact; his size, athleticism, and ballhandling ability will lead to a lot of defensive fouls drawn. Dangerous on dives to the rim via pick-and-rolls and handoffs; he can flush lobs like DeAndre Jordan or pass on the short roll like Draymond Green. A smart, unselfish passer who thrives in transition; he lacks supreme vision, but his excellent rebounding and coast-to-coast ability are valuable tools. Punishes smaller players on perimeter drives and post-ups. Has basic moves now, but displays the dexterity and body control necessary to improve. An active and aware cutter who can exploit holes in defenses, even when they sag off him on the perimeter. Hustles and plays with a winning mind-set: dives for loose balls, rebounds out of his area, and pursues chasedown blocks.

Needs to overhaul his shooting mechanics: His release is too low and his elbow sticks out. The ball gets pushed from his forehead. He’s a natural lefty who shoots righty. Must improve his right hand. Becoming more of a one-foot leaper would enhance his finishing, too. Struggles shooting jumpers off the dribble largely due to his poor mechanics, which cause him to transition slowly into his release. Motor and focus wane when defending off-ball, leading to backdoor cuts and open shooters. Is it due to his heavy offensive role, or is it for a lack of interest? Narrow frame limits his defensive upside. He’s not someone who can switch onto larger players.",Point guard,"Electric passer who generates open space for teammates with speed and sleights of hand, and then accurately delivers the ball using either hand off the dribble. Excellent shot-creation upside. He has a quick first step and uses slippery crossovers, spins, in-out dribbles, and changes of pace to create space. Major potential as a transition threat with his handle, speed, and unselfish passing ability. Touch from the line and around the rim suggests he could be a good shooter if he makes the necessary mechanical changes. Terrific athlete who explodes for open-floor dunks and has the top-gear speed to zoom by defenders. Crafty finisher who absorbs contact well, though he still must get stronger. Has the instincts of a role player, too: does the little things like cutting, rebounding, and facilitating within the flow of the offense.

He rarely uses his right hand, as if it were tied behind back. It’s critical that he improve his off hand to diversify his shot-creation ability. His lousy percentages from 3 and the line are alarming since he has good, consistent mechanics. Lacks natural touch, an issue that is compounded by his diminished athleticism in tight space, which hinders his at-rim scoring. Inactive off-ball player on offense: He rarely ever cuts or screens at Duke, though his athleticism and versatility could make him a potential threat down the road. He’s a ball watcher off-ball who routinely misses defensive rotations; on-ball, he often falls out of his stance possibly due to a lack of interest, awareness, or energy.",Forward,"Good athlete in space with smooth footwork who seeks contact on drives. Dangerous ball handler who takes long strides and uses a bevy of herky-jerky maneuvers like Euro-steps and hesitations to get to the rim. Effective shooter off the dribble from midrange: He’s comfortable transitioning into his shot, especially when driving left, and he’s flashed a slick stepback. Good ball handler and passer for his size who can make any type of pass off the dribble. Though he’s not a pure playmaker, he can fit into any multi-ball-handler offense. Excellent rebounder for his position; when he snatches boards, he’s a constant threat to go coast-to-coast. Competitive defender at lower levels, especially playing for Team Canada.

While a good defender, he does tend to get smoked by quicker, explosive players—which he’ll see far more of in the NBA. Unless he has space to gather, he’s a below-the-rim finisher who doesn’t finish well inside against contact or lengthy defenders. Questionable feel for the game; he’s a ball stopper who makes delayed reads, though he has made slight progress as a passer each season. Lacks defensive playmaking skill; doesn’t log many explosive plays in the blocks or steals columns though it’s partially a product of Virginia’s defense scheme. Solid rebounder, though he’ll need to show more skill to excel in a small-ball frontcourt role.",Forward,"Good spot-up shooter who has a sense for relocating and cutting, though he should quicken his shooting release. His shot creation has improved considerably; he can get to the rim on straight-line drives, make basic one- or two-dribble pull-ups, and face up from the post. Good on-ball perimeter defender due to his notable combination of mass, length, and quickness. Plays sound positional defense off-ball; he rotates well, minimizes mistakes, and has the bulk to neutralize rim runners when helping in the pick-and-roll. Stout post defender due to strength, length, and strong base; he’s hard to overpower.

Doesn’t draw a ton of fouls and is a below-the-rim athlete; with his lean frame, finishing could be a challenge despite his skill. Shooting has never been an issue for him at lower levels, but his release is a little low, so it’ll be worth monitoring how it translates against NBA length. Needs to limit unnecessary risks where he tries to be flashy instead of making a fundamental play. A torn meniscus in his left knee ended his season at Vanderbilt.",Point guard,"Seasoned pick-and-roll playmaker with tremendous feel and tempo; he uses elusive moves like half-spins, hesitations, and hang dribbles to generate space. The ball doesn’t slow him down; he’s a speedster in the open floor able to split defenders, and he’s agile when changing directions. Smooth shooter with NBA range off the dribble, off the catch, and off movement; his versatility will enable him to easily excel in a multiple ball handler offense. Dexterity makes him a constant threat to pass or score from anywhere; he’s not a great at-rim finisher yet, but makes acrobatic extension layups with either hand.

Struggled to shoot off the dribble even after creating space for open looks. Has wild misses to the left and right when pulling up. Forces shots and tries to do too much with his dribble to get through traffic; he’ll need to play a steadier brand of basketball at the next level to earn the trust of coaches. Needs to add strength and play with sound fundamentals to overcome his slight frame and short wingspan; he’s not going to be versatile. Mobility and effort can make him a good overall defender, especially off the ball, but at this stage his fundamentals remain sloppy in terms of footwork and positioning.",Point guard,"Effective spot-up 3-point shooter from NBA range with a quick release. White has long-term potential off screens and handoffs due to his ability to balance himself midair, but he wasn’t efficient in this area during his freshman season. Creates tons of space off the dribble, especially on his stepback jumper. There’s go-to scoring potential if he masters his shot and handle. Can glide past the defense with an elite first step, yet also displays a feel for stop-and-go hesitations and hang dribbles. Solid facilitator who can make basic passes off the dribble; will need to enhance this part of his game to complement his scoring ability at the next level.

Takes far too many unforced midrange 2-pointers early in the clock. Telegraphs too many passes and lacks accuracy, so at this stage he’s more of a secondary ball handler than a primary creator. Limited ceiling as a defender: He has room to get stronger, but he still has a relatively lean frame, and he has only average lateral quickness against guards.",Guard,"Intelligent player who moves well without the ball, fills lanes on the break, and plays hard. Good straight-line driver who mixes in spin moves and finishes with either hand around the rim, though he must improve at finishing versus length. Solid dribble-jumper shooter; comfortable taking side dribbles into 3s, pull-ups, and stepbacks, though his footwork will need to improve at the pro level. Makes tough shots, especially from midrange. If those 2s become 3s, he could become an end-of-game scorer. Flashes upside shooting off screens and handoffs, though his below-average free throw percentage and lack of touch on floaters are worrisome indicators for his actual shooting ability. Unselfish passer who facilitates well within the system and can make plays off the bounce for others. Shows good feel with change-of-pace moves in the pick-and-roll. Competitive rebounder who can initiate a fast break as a scorer or playmaker.

Loses balance on drives to the rim; he lacks coordination, slips and falls, and will fumble the ball even without pressure. Settles too much for jumpers despite only appearing like a knockdown shooter; his mechanics look smooth, but he’s shot low 30 percent from 3 throughout his career. Not an above-the-rim finisher in traffic, and he avoids using his off hand; converts on plays around the rim at a much lower rate than you’d expect. Telegraphs too many passes; he plays a casual overall game, and needs to put zip on the ball to get it where he wants it to go. Lacks discipline on defense: He falls for pump fakes, reaches too often, and gambles in situations when he should just play positional defense. Defensive effort flutters too much; his mind-set could be the difference between becoming Paul George or Jeff Green.",Forward,"Wide upper body with a long wingspan that can support more muscle, though his hips are slender; added strength could improve some of his weaknesses. Fluidity, size, and an array of ball-handling moves and hesitations enable him to hit pull-up perimeter jumpers that most players can’t. Projects as a plus shooter off the catch due to his quick, high release. With his size, he could develop into a pick-and-pop threat. Does a fine job of relocating off-ball and cutting, though the results aren’t great due to a lack of explosiveness inside and a streaky shot outside. Good passer for his size: He’s adept at creating space and making reads in the pick-and-roll, though he’s had limited opportunities due to the presence of star teammates. Switchable defender with long arms and quick hands to swipe at ball handlers; he defends on his heels too much, though, which hinders his lateral quickness.

Adding weight in college has allowed him to be a big for UNC, but it’s sapped him of the lateral quickness that made him an elite high school defender. Looks puzzled on offense. He record-scratches the offense, pauses, settles for contested pull-ups, and dribbles into traffic instead of locating open teammates. Lacks fluidity driving the ball. He has some crossovers and in-out dribble moves, but he’s stiff. Struggles spot-up shooting. He has some bad misses, including air balls.",Forward,"Ideal body for positionless basketball with a thick, muscular frame, long arms, and explosive athleticism.

He could also be used as a roller in the pick-and-roll due to his explosiveness and ability to absorb and finish through contact. Comfortable attacking closeouts to get to the rim.

Banging down low won’t be a focus, but he needs to improve at burying defenders underneath the rim and finishing at tough angles. Inexperienced: He’s often a beat late making reads, doesn’t screen well, and sloppily executes simple plays like dribble handoffs. Reluctant with his left hand; he dunked nearly everything in college, but finishing at an elite level in the NBA requires more dexterity. Potential health concerns.

Good free throw shooter who also has soft touch on hook shots from the short midrange; there’s a chance he could someday develop a spot-up jumper. Has the potential to become an elite rim protector: alters shots with his mere presence, and his long wingspan allows him to clog passing lanes. Excellent lateral quickness defending on the perimeter. May one day be able to switch, or defend pick-and-rolls regardless of the coverage. High-effort, attentive defender who’ll recover for chase-down blocks, which can mask some of his raw fundamentals.

Poor defensive fundamentals. He defends flat-footed, which slows him down laterally, and falls out of his stance, putting his hands down or wildly opening his hips when changing directions.

Sluggish first step turning the corner on drives to the rim limits his shot-creation ability. Lacks explosiveness to regularly finish once he gets inside. Doesn’t have the lateral quickness to effectively defend quicker players on switches; he got burned in Kentucky’s final game against Auburn. Has the requisite length and effort to be an effective defender, but needs to develop more attention to detail.",Guard,"Quick shooting release with NBA range; he’s capable of catching and shooting the ball at tough angles. Herro’s upside shooting off the dribble is his most tantalizing skill. He’s comfortable with sidestep pull-ups, especially going to his left. Natural feel for off-ball relocation to get open for spot-up jumpers or cuts to the basket; he’ll wear out defenders with his constant, deceptive movement. Has potential as a crafty interior finisher; he has a soft floater and he’s adept at using his off hand on layups. Intelligent passer who knows how to leverage his height to pass over the defense. Runs hard in transition to the wings and corners for 3s. Hustles on defense and crashes the boards. His physical profile should support more muscle, which would allow him to defend stronger NBA wings and forwards.

Ideal role is small-ball 5, but a lack of length and strength will hinder his ability to defend larger elite bigs like Joel Embiid and Karl-Anthony Towns. Underwhelming defensive rebounder given his athletic gifts. Shooting upside is only theoretical: He overhauled his form after transferring from San Jose State to Gonzaga, but he still has rigid release and shoots a mediocre percentage from the line.",Big,"Impressively logged as many blocks as missed shots during the regular season at Gonzaga. Explosive leaper with soft hands to catch tough passes, and the ambidexterity and spatial awareness to finish in a crowd. Good decision-maker. The type of player who plays “good to great” basketball by grabbing a rebound and locating an open teammate instead of forcing up a careless, contested shot. Handles the ball well for his size; he can take rebounds and go coast-to-coast. He’s mostly a straight-line driver but likes using a spin move to his right. Sets solid screens, and has good feel and timing on dives to the rim; with his passing and dribbling skill, he could be a weapon on the short roll. Strong indicators that he will develop a perimeter game: touch on floaters, post fadeaways, hook shots, and midrange jumpers. Plays his ass off. Makes the extra effort, attacks the offensive boards, dives for loose balls, and hustles back in transition. Excellent shot blocker. He’s a fast-twitch leaper who perfectly times his jumps and uses the rule of verticality to alter shots without fouling. Projects well as a pick-and-roll defender.

Gets into foul trouble because he leaps at pump fakes and gets too handsy on the perimeter when he’s a beat late due to his slow feet.

Projects as a positive spot-up shooter; he has the touch and smooth, consistent mechanics to continue to extend his range beyond the NBA 3-point line. Good passing vision, especially on the short roll, locating and accurately delivering the ball to shooters and cutters. Smart and competitive defender who understands proper positioning and fundamentals; he’s long, and has the potential to effectively drop in pick-and-roll coverages.

Inactive off-ball player, though that might’ve been a symptom of the college offense he played in. His ballhandling is largely flash and little substance at this point due to his looseness while attempting most moves. Lacks off-ball defensive awareness. He gets caught looking at the ball and loses his man. His motor is inconsistent, and he has to learn when to gamble. Doesn’t stay seated in an on-ball defensive stance, and he’s often flat-footed; he also swipes at the ball and bites on fakes, causing him to stumble out of position. Maturity is a concern: He was suspended indefinitely midseason at USC for an undisclosed off-court reason, and tends to take poor shots outside of the offensive system on the court.",Guard,"Excellent physical profile with a strong frame and long arms; NBA spacing could someday allow him to be an explosive force driving to the rim.

He has confidence in his stepback jumper, which could someday be his go-to shot. Showed solid passing instincts and a greater willingness to create for others after returning from a foot injury in February.

He had a late growth spurt, so either he’s just adjusting to his new body or lacks a degree of toughness. He should be considered no more than a theoretical shooting threat because of his average touch near the rim and his subpar percentages on his jumper and from the line. Must do a better job of establishing post positioning, especially when sealing defenders underneath the basket on cuts and rim runs. Thin frame allows beefier players to plow through him on the post and perimeter drives; he needs to get significantly stronger to effectively defend bigs. Too often stands upright or opens his stance on the perimeter, which allows opponents to blow by him. He needs to stay seated in his stance and move laterally on his heels.",Big,"Good ball handler who can grab-and-go in transition, or score with finesse on cuts and rolls. He stays low on his drives and scores like a guard around the rim with dexterous layups. Effective passer who could easily thrive as a scorer or playmaker on the short roll.

Avoided careless turnovers despite being forced into being a primary playmaker; he won’t have the same role in the NBA, but his skills will make him a tough cover in the pick-and-roll. Didn’t play with a point guard, which hurt his percentages: He shot 34.6 percent in two years on catch-and-shoot jumpers, which isn’t good but it’s something to build on. Good rebounder considering his underdeveloped body, though stronger bigs will move him off his spots until he adds muscle. Impressive defensive potential once his fundamentals improve: He’s mobile moving laterally and plays hard, plus has the length and reaction time to contain guards and wings.

Putting actual effort into his screens would pay dividends. Slow to react to pressure when playing in the post; it often seems like he doesn’t realize that passing the ball is an option. Poor effort plagues his defense: He fails to contest shots, help, communicate, and box out for rebounds. You won’t find him hustling back on defense. Lacks fundamentals; he plays high defending the post and can’t get low on the perimeter, which probably isn’t solvable due to his high center of gravity.

Terrific spot-up shooter, despite his funky mechanics. If his screening improves, he’ll become a pick-and-pop weapon. Tantalizing upside as a scorer off the dribble; few bigs can dribble and shoot as well as he does. However, his lack of strength and burst do limit his upside creating against a set defense. Flashes post upside with basic moves that culminate in a right hook. He’ll need to get stronger to carve out space closer to the rim. Potential deterrent around the rim due to his sheer length.

Foul trouble is an issue; it’s as if he were conditioned to leap at pump fakes and swipe for the ball. Savvy NBA veterans will exploit this tendency.

It’s not necessarily a bad thing since he knows his role, but he’s yet to tap into his athleticism. Needs to speed up his jump shot release, and too often flares out his elbow, which may be a cause of inconsistency. Not someone who will create many at-rim chances for himself. He can make simple moves but hasn’t shown he can keep the ball on a string. At-rim finishing is lacking but could improve if he develops athleticism leaping off one foot.",Guard,"Beast off-ball defender potential: He’s both athletic and smart.

He forces wild shots underneath the rim instead of locating shooters. Loose handle that sometimes comes up above his shoulders. He needs tighten it up or won’t be nearly as effective in an NBA setting. Slow moving laterally on defense. He’s often out of position and plays float-footed, but with his thick frame and wide hips, he just might not be quick enough on the perimeter.

Poor set shooter off the catch with a tense release and a high-arcing moon ball that yields wild results. He’s also a subpar free throw shooter. Defensive awareness must improve.

Capable post scorer who can use his big frame to bury defenders underneath the rim; he’s also a reliable passer, so perhaps he could develop as a post playmaking presence.

Ambidextrous finisher who attacks going left or right; he lacks shake or elite burst, but his quick first step, dexterity, and feel make him a serviceable live dribble threat. Displayed an aptitude for shooting off movement with handoffs or side-dribble pull-ups, though his current success rate off the dribble from 3 is subpar.

If he improves, he can be a solid passer within the flow of the offense. Lacks length and lateral quickness: Even when he’s locked in, he tends to get blown by; he’s not quick enough against guards or big enough against forwards. Critical that he masters his defensive fundamentals to stay on the floor. He gets caught off-balance in man-to-man situations and when closing out to contest shooters.",Forward,"Good spot-up shooter who’s capable of hitting one- or two-dribble pull-ups with his lefty stroke.

Good footwork on drives to the rim and he’s effective finishing with either hand from tough angles below the rim, which helps overcome his lack of quickness. Sprints up the floor in transition to get open for corner 3s. He can push the ball up the floor himself and loves using a right-to-left crossover to get to the rim.

Right-hand dominant finisher who would benefit from adding a left to overcome his lack of elite athleticism around the rim. He ran some point in college, but doesn’t project as a primary ball handler in the NBA given his lack of burst and the looseness of his ballhandling.

Streaky shooter who misses wildly on jumpers, including air balls; it could be a mechanical flaw that hasn’t yet impacted his percentages, but it’s noteworthy since his shot is crucial to his success. Undersized player who will get picked on defensively in playoff situations when teams frequently attack the opponent’s weaker links. He played zone in college, so he’ll need to prove he can adapt to a man-to-man scheme, fighting over screens and rotating.",Guard,"Shifty ball handler who gets where he wants on the floor thanks to his slick footwork and tight handle, featuring spins and crossovers; he changes speeds and directions instantly.

He can score acrobatically through contact using either hand due to his elite body control and soft touch. Plus, he has an excellent floater.

Underrated passer: He flashes serious playmaking skills by making difficult cross-court passes to shooters and bounce passes to cutters.

Teams won’t want the ball in his hands much on offense. Slow decision-maker who can mostly only be relied on to make very basic passes at this stage of his career.

He closes out, contests shots, and stays in his stance. He’s not quick laterally, but the effort is there. Great rebounder who is a threat for putback dunks. He has strong hands and rarely gets stripped after offensive boards. Solid free throw shooter and midrange shooter with good touch inside. Lob threat, though he needs more experience and coaching in the pick-and-roll. Also didn’t run the floor much in college.

Low block and steal rates are notable considering his elite measurables and theoretical defensive potential. Occasionally drifts on the perimeter. His hands have improved since high school, but he still occasionally fumbles passes.",Center,"Has wide shoulders and a thick frame with room to add even more muscle. Bouncy athlete vertically, but also very fluid and agile. He has light feet like a dancer, and runs the floor like a T-800 android. Excellent finisher around the rim using either hand.

Better ball handler attacking from the perimeter than he was able to show at Arizona. Underrated passer who makes accurate outlets and kickouts to shooters and cutters. Stays under control when facing pressure or doubles. Good rebounder due to his sheer athletic advantage.

He shows flashes as a pick-and-roll ball handler and puts great velocity on his passes. Plays intense defense and crashes the boards. He’s not a lockdown guy, but he plays team basketball.

He grew up playing two-guard, and it shows with his movement relocating, running through screens, and cutting. Skilled at-rim finisher who has touch, uses either hand, and can make difficult wrong-footed layups against length and athleticism. He’s a fairly explosive leaper in the open floor. He’ll sometimes surprise you with big dunks driving in traffic. Improved ball handler who changes speeds, uses spin moves and Eurosteps, and shows good feel and pace in the pick-and-roll.

Low release on his jumper and inconsistent roles are worrisome for his chances of developing into a sharpshooter. Rarely drives to his right, which makes him predictable. Potential defensive liability; he’s too lean to defend larger players, too slow to defend quicker ones. Loses focus defending off-ball and doesn’t crash the boards enough.",Small Forward,"Quick-trigger shooter capable of unloading from tough angles either off screens or off the dribble. Good pick-and-roll threat because of his ability to pull up from deep, wiggle his way to the paint, or make basic passes off the dribble.

Plays hard enough to survive against both guard spots.",Oregon,sophomore,180,77.0,100.0,-2.9,-0.2
192,22.2,44.0,2017,81.0,ALEC PETERS,"Limited scorer. His slow first step won’t allow him to create space against top-level athletes. Lacks explosive scoring and lateral quickness to defend the perimeter, limiting his upside. A modern tweener: can’t switch onto guards or protect the rim and doesn’t make up for it as a rebounder, though he hustles.",Stretch Forward,"Good shooter with a quick release and smooth footwork on the move who appears comfortable from NBA range. Great post skills allow him to seal off a defender under the rim and finish with both hands. Smart player with good instincts: great fundamentals and reliable, though occasionally telegraphs passes.",Valparaiso,senior,225,83.0,105.0,-2.8,0.0
193,20.7,45.0,2017,79.0,PJ DOZIER,"Poor shooter who needs to overhaul his mechanics. Flings the ball at the rim. Also subpar from the free throw line. Average feel for the game; his success will largely depend on his athleticism. Has high defensive potential, but needs to improve his fundamentals to avoid committing careless fouls like reach-ins.",Guard,"Tremendous athlete with high defensive upside; explosive in the open floor, with long arms and excellent lateral quickness. Multipositional defender: could effectively switch onto guards, wings, and leaner forwards. Can create space off the dribble; he changes directions quickly and gets to the rim. Solid playmaker who can take on secondary pick-and-roll duties. Tightened his handle as a sophomore, but still needs work.",South Carolina,sophomore,200,83.0,101.0,-20.4,0.0
194,23.1,46.0,2017,77.0,DAMYEAN DOTSON,"Off-ball defense needs work; he needs to refine his footwork on closeouts to avoid getting blown by. Struggles creating his shot off the dribble; he’s a rigid ball handler and doesn’t change directions smoothly. Settles for a lot of jumpers, doesn’t get to the rim frequently, and rarely draws fouls. In 2014, Dotson was dismissed from the Oregon basketball team after he was accused of sexual assault. Charges were dropped because of a lack of evidence.",Wing,"Good defender who moves well laterally, plays hard, competes against larger opponents, and has a nose for rebounding. Excellent spot-up shooter from a standstill, on the move, or running off screens. Solid passer who tends to make the right decision on the floor. He has a good feel for moving the ball and executing plays. Good size, length, and frame for a wing. He’s a plus athlete who zooms in the open floor.",Houston,senior,202,81.0,100.0,-2.3,0.0
195,22.6,47.0,2017,77.0,SINDARIUS THORNWELL,"Substandard first step. Subpar shooter who needs to extend his range. Currently shoots flat with a low release and looks uncomfortable off the dribble. Relies too heavily on drawing fouls and plowing through defenders to score, which may not translate at the higher level.",Wing,"Intense defender with quickness to defend guards, size to defend bigs and rebound. Experienced in both pick-and-rolls and post-ups, while also passing well and able to play off-ball. Advanced ballhandling skills make him a potential secondary playmaker.",South Carolina,senior,214,82.0,103.0,-2.4,-0.1
196,22.3,48.0,2017,80.0,DEVIN ROBINSON,Suffered a left-foot stress fracture in 2016. Needs to improve finishing at the rim with his off-hand. Predictable driving to the rim; he almost always goes right since his left-hand handle is so underdeveloped. Will need to prove that his shot will translate to the NBA despite his odd shooting form. Frustratingly inconsistent player who loses focus on defense and becomes passive on offense.,Wing,"Excellent athlete who excels in transition and off-cuts due to elite leaping ability. Unorthodox shooting mechanics, but he’s developed into a good 3-point shooter. Floats in the air when attacking the rim, which leads to a lot of drawn fouls. If he adds strength, he may finish through the contact. Gets high elevation pulling up off the dribble, looks smooth; if he extends to 3-point range off the bounce, he could exceed expectations. Great defensive potential; long, can defend multiple positions, and rebounds well.",Florida,junior,200,85.0,106.0,-2.1,0.0
197,24.0,49.0,2017,79.0,ANDREW WHITE,"Subpar passer who takes too many risks as a passer or doesn’t deliver the ball with accuracy. Handle gets sloppy, especially going to his left, which leads to careless turnovers driving into traffic. Has only an average first step, limiting his ability to create in the half court. Also lacks explosiveness scoring in traffic. Transferred twice in college; he’s still underdeveloped at age 24, so teams better be certain he’s willing to stick around in the G-League.",Wing,"Excellent spot-up shooter with NBA range who shows flashes shooting off screens. Capable shooting one- or two- dribble pull-up jumpers, or jabbing then shooting out of the triple-threat stance. Excels in complementary offensive skills like running the floor in transition, filling space off-ball, and moving the ball. Solid at-rim finisher who handles contact well, though he should attempt to integrate his left hand more frequently. Flashed defensive potential as an underclassman at Nebraska and Kansas; his combo of strength and lateral quickness give him versatile upside.",Syracuse,senior,220,NaN,NaN,-5.5,-0.02
198,23.8,50.0,2017,79.0,JARON BLOSSOMGAME,"Suffered a litany of leg injuries, including a shattered tibia in high school. Teams will want to know his medical history. Inconsistent shooting mechanics lead to too many bad misses and airballs. His release is low and he has shoddy footwork. Stiff ball handler with subpar passing vision, limiting him to straight-line drives when attacking closeouts. May need to learn how to better navigate pick-and-roll screens when defending wings.",Wing,"Off-the-charts intangibles; plays with fire and passion, maximizing his athleticism and strong frame. Versatile defender with the quickness to cover guards and the bulk to cover forwards. Excellent rebounder who gets ahead in transition, with good timing on cuts and ability to attack closeouts. Soft touch on jump hooks, floaters, and free throws. With tweaks to his mechanics, he could become a reliable spot-up shooter.",Clemson,senior,214,82.0,105.0,-3.8,-0.2
199,19.9,51.0,2017,83.0,THOMAS BRYANT,"Rushes; sets moving screens, has sloppy footwork, makes panicked passes, throws up wild layups. Subpar rebounder for his size. He boxes out but doesn’t rebound outside his area or outmuscle NBA-caliber bigs for 50-50 balls. Lost defensively due to poor fundamentals. Gets caught flat-footed and is slow to accelerate laterally. He can’t hedge or switch. Not a rim protector. Has length but he’s not a leaper. Typically a beat late on rotations, which gets him into foul trouble.",Big,"Mammoth wingspan with great physical dimensions that he doesn’t take for granted; plays his ass off, communicates. Super-active defender who could be effective in a pick-and-roll defense that drops rather than hedges. High-energy big on offense who hustles in transition and throws his body around inside. Can finish off-balance under the rim off cuts and the pick-and-roll. Solid 3-point-shooting potential with a quick release that can be further refined. Tightened his ballhandling to improve attacking closeouts.",Indiana,sophomore,241,90.0,113.0,-3.3,0.0
200,20.9,52.0,2017,80.0,CAMERON OLIVER,"Above-average rebounder who could dominate if he played with consistent effort, though his height and reach are limitations. Lacks defensive fundamentals; he doesn’t stay in his stance, misses rotations, and looks lost in the pick-and-roll. Poor basketball IQ; commits careless turnovers, fails to execute simple plays, dribbles into traffic, takes too many shots early in the clock. Struggles shooting off the dribble; he airballs or hits the backboard too frequently. Settles for jumpers too often against switches rather than overpowering inside because he has poor post footwork.",Forward,"High upside as a lob threat in the pick-and-roll; he excels most with spacing in transition. Explosive at-rim finisher: delivers contact, draws fouls, and dunks through defenders. Good fluidity as a ball handler; he uses Euro-steps and crossovers and has a quick first step. Fast-twitch athlete with potential to defend multiple positions. Solid spot-up shooter; his form is inconsistent, but he has solid touch and hits shots.",Nevada,sophomore,225,85.0,107.0,,
201,21.4,53.0,2017,77.0,LJ PEAK,"Defensive fundamentals must improve to maximize his potential, particularly his positioning on the perimeter. Lacks rebounding instincts. Poor shooting mechanics; his form looks different each time, his elbow sticks out like a chicken wing, and he has a low release. Struggled shooting from 3-point range off the dribble. He looks like he’s heaving the ball.",Guard,"Clear defensive upside; he has long arms, a strong frame, and moves laterally quickly. He plays extremely hard and puts his body on the line. Fluid athlete who changes directions smoothly while slashing to the rim or handling in transition. Knows how to fill a complementary offensive role; excels at cutting, filling space in transition, and quickly passing the ball. Excellent ball handler who can run pick-and-roll. To manipulate the defense, he changes gears and uses crossovers, hesitations, and hang dribbles. Good free throw shooter and and his success with the pull-up jumper suggests upside spotting up.",Georgetown,junior,215,82.0,103.0,,
202,21.8,54.0,2017,78.0,DWAYNE BACON,Low-effort defender with poor fundamentals. Doesn’t fight over screens or close out hard. Mediocre basketball IQ. Takes too many contested midrange jumpers early in the clock. Forces contested shots rather than passing to open teammates. Needs to improve his off-hand so he’s not predictable. Usually tries to drive right and rarely uses his left at the rim. Subpar spot-up shooter with shaky mechanics. He can hit shots but needs to smoothen his release; looks less comfortable when he’s rushed.,Wing,"Excellent scorer in the open floor. He’s a bowling ball attacking closeouts and slashing in transition. Can finish through contact. Aggressive ball handler with good footwork on drives. Uses Euro-steps and side steps. Can pull up on a dime off the dribble. At his best going downhill, and can navigate pick-and-roll well. Has upside as a screen-game threat if his shot translates. Defensive upside is there, despite his flaws. He has a thick, muscular frame with a solid wingspan. Great rebounder.",Florida State,sophomore,202,82.0,104.0,-4.7,-0.5
203,22.4,55.0,2017,80.0,V.J. BEACHEM,"Ball slows him down due to his high dribble, limiting his upside scoring off the dribble. Struggles driving all the way to the rim and doesn’t finish well through contact. Needs to play with more force and passion. Doesn’t box out, rebound well, or play as effectively against physical players. Narrow frame will make it difficult for him to add muscle. Off-ball defense needs to improve. He gambles too much, his footwork on closeouts is underdeveloped, and he’s often a beat late on rotations.",Forward,"Fluid athlete who finishes well in transition and on cuts. NBA spacing will aid his ability to drive in a straight line to the rim. Great shooting upside; can splash 3s off screens and dribble handoffs, and he excels on spot-ups. Needs a quicker release, though. Capable of shooting a one-dribble pullup, though he needs to add side-step or step-back moves to his footwork. Good basketball IQ. He plays within himself, makes smart passes, and doesn’t hold the ball. Versatile defensive upside due to good length for his position. He can slide with guards and block shots from the weakside.",Notre Dame,senior,200,82.0,105.0,,
204,22.1,56.0,2017,79.0,BEN MOORE,"Struggles shooting; he has funky mechanics that need to be overhauled. Crucial that he improves his shot, otherwise it limits the rest of his positive offensive traits. Lack of size could limit his interior defense against true bigs, making him more of a matchup-based option. Subpar rebounder due to lack of size. He boxes out and competes, but puts up average rebounding numbers.",Forward,"Energetic forward who plays with reckless abandon. High-IQ player who does all the little things on the floor. Untapped ballhandling skills; he can bring the ball up and he shines passing from the perimeter. Excellent interior finisher off pick-and-rolls, cuts, or offensive rebounds. He’s explosive, and does a good job finishing with either hand. Adept switching screens on the perimeter. Slides his feet well against guards, wings, and stretch forwards. Does a good job of contesting shots without fouling. Effective help defender, as he rotates well to block shots from the weak side.",SMU,senior,203,83.0,105.0,,
205,22.4,57.0,2017,77.0,STERLING BROWN,"Lacks speed and ballhandling ability to turn the corner on drives, and the explosiveness to finish inside. Subpar passing vision and change-of-direction ability.",Wing,"Excellent spot-up shooter with sound mechanics, a quick release, and NBA range. Capable shooter off the dribble, though he lacks dynamic moves. Plays extremely hard defensively: fights through screens, defends with toughness against larger players, and rebounds well.

Unreliable decision-maker who makes inaccurate passes and careless plays. Ineffective shooter off the dribble, which directly inhibits his ability to drive the lane with defenders going under screens. Struggles shooting off the catch. Has rigid mechanics that have no consistency. Poor touch on layups and floaters doesn’t bode well for his jumper developing.",Point Guard,"Excellent size for a modern guard, with long arms and the frame to get stronger. High pick-and-roll potential due to measurables and body control, but needs to round off the rougher edges of his game. Terrific first step makes him shine in transition and allows him to fly by defenders in the half court. Talented ball handler, though he needs to tighten it up going to his left. Upside to be versatile defender who can switch screens, though effort and fundamentals must improve.",Xavier,sophomore,170,81.0,103.0,6.9,0.0
207,22.0,59.0,2017,78.0,DAVON REED,Only an above-average athlete despite elite physical profile; he suffered a torn left meniscus in 2014. Suffers lapses as an off-ball defender; late on rotations or closeouts. Limited ball handler who shouldn’t be expected to create without a screen. He doesn’t use his left hand enough finishing at the rim.,Wing,"Effective shooter with a high release who excels spotting up but can also drain one-dribble pull-ups and stepbacks. Good straight-line driver when attacking closeouts or in transition. Reliable passer who moves the ball within the flow of the offense.

208,21.9,60.0,2017,75.0,MONTE MORRIS,"Must extend dribble-jumper range to 3 to reach next level; he front-rims a lot of misses. Below-the-rim finisher with mediocre quickness, so creating and finishing against NBA athletes could be a struggle. One-position defender, as his slight frame and short arms make it easy for even guards to plow through him.",Point Guard,"Elite passer who makes smart, creative plays and rarely turns the ball over. Savvy pick-and-roll ball handler who navigates screens and manipulates defenders with change of pace to get where he wants. Capable shooter off the dribble from midrange and on spot-up shots despite unorthodox mechanics. Plays hard defensively, makes good rotations, and rebounds well for his position. Makes a consistent impact. He’s a reliable player coaches can lean on to right the ship.",Iowa State,senior,175,76.0,97.0,9.4,0.1
