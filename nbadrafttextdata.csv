","While a fluid athlete, he lacks the explosiveness and overall quickness and athleticism to stand out at the next level … Lacks upper body strength. Appears to shy away from contact at times. A finesse player who is most comfortable facing the basket and knocking down mid-range shots … And lack of physicality may limit his effectiveness on the boards and defensively … Averagd 2.4 blocked shots per game, but there is some question about whether he could do that against a higher level of competition … Known for being a quality shooter, however his 25% 3 point shooting in his senior year was surprisingly bad … Had strong #s but level of competition concerns could temper scout’s reviews of him … His inability to step up in the NCAA tourney did his stock no favors …

Huge hands, wide shoulders and an enormous wingspan gives him great ability to dunk the ball with power … He’s very athletic, long, quick & fast. With a 7’1 wingspan & impressive inch vertical he poses nightmare problems in terms of mismatches … Able to overpower smaller defenders & bigger defenders get ""outquicked"" and often dunked on … Bennett is best at the power game in the paint, where at least 70 % of his scoring total comes from … When charting his shots on the season he has literally scored from every power spot on the floor … He favors the right side of the floor consisting of floaters, tip ins, reverse layups & dunks 60% of the time. Bennett’s 42 dunks put him among the country’s leaders. Bennett has made 23 3 pointers this season and averages 1 make per game. Bennett’s sweet spot is the left perimeter where he’s made 40% of his 3 pointers. His go to midrange move is his face up jumper from the right baseline … Two words that bode well for Bennett’s future are productivity and efficiency … He is so efficient that if he played 40 minutes per game he would average 26.2 points per game … He has the innate ability to create spacing which helps him to score whether it’s freezing a defender with a jab step or flaring off of a screen to catch & shoot or flat out blowing by a defender for a power dunk … Bennett continually shows his versatility which raises his intrigue … Bennett’s footwork is excellent, especially for someone of his size. Along with his footwork, Bennett’s shooting mechanics are very good. His form never changes on his shot. His shoulders are always squared and facing the basket. His release point is the same & even his misses look good … Bennett is extremely adept at drawing fouls and goes to the stripe an average of 6 times per game, knocking down 75% of his free throws … Bennett is an adept ball handler and has gone coast to coast 4 times this season. He maintains a low dribble and is rarely caught upright. Based upon playing 40 minutes, he averages only 2 turnovers. As stated earlier, with his tremendous skill set & ability to draw fouls he commands a great deal of attention defensively …
","Somewhat of a tweener as he is slightly undersized for a full time PF (though that’s likely his future position) and slow defensively to play the SF position … The major concern for Bennett going into this season was his health. His prep career was marred with injuries as he was not able to finish out either his junior or senior seasons. On the positive side he hasn’t had any such problems in college having not missed a single practice much less game … There are some questions about his toughness. He’s got a massive frame with incredible strength, but for as big and strong as he is, it doesn’t always appear that he seeks out contact, or play with ferocity on the boards … While averaging a team high 8 rebounds a game, at times he appears disinterested defensively. In Bennett’s defense he spent the beginning of the season defending the opposition’s Center until teammate Khem Birch became eligible, but defending is also about desire.

His ability to convert plays while operating at such a high rate of speed is very intriguing … Smart kid and considered a high character individual … 
","Throughout his high school and AAU career he flashed tremendous talent but struggled to sustain a high level of consistency … Can lose focus at times during games, but has been a lot more consistent and prepared then expected … He needs to continue to show a high level of aggression and intensity in order to realize his immense talent … Shot shows high potential but still has some minor kinks in his mechanics that need to be ironed out in order to add range and consistency … Should look to improve upon his current 62% FT shooting …

","Though McRae has good height and exceptional length, he is a twig at 179 lbs and will need to get much stronger ..  Has a narrow frame and thin shoulders, so it will be harder for him to put on weight without losing athleticism more so than some of the other more thin prospects … Some real question marks about his ability to add legitimate strength .. Struggles to deal with contact…Though he is a confident shooter, his efficiency can definitely stand to improve … Didn’t really shoot the 3-ball well down the stretch last season … His shooting mechanics also need to tighten up, as his inconsistencies can likely be related to his unconventional form … Sometimes forces contested shots … Ball-handling skills need work … Doesn’t hold up that well to tight ball pressure … Not a truly good isolation player, though he at times had to look to score in these situations due to a lack of perimeter scorers around him…A big high-waisted, and can be a little stiff moving laterally … Though he has matured and become a smarter player, his feel for the game and basketball IQ can still improve … Is 23 years old, so he is older than many other prospects …
Overall: McRae’s ability to score, mixed with his really good physical tools could make him a draft day selection … He could be a good defender in the NBA and if he gets his jumper more consistent, he will have a real good chance at a nice career for himself … Problem is, he never developed the consistency he needed with his shot in college, and he’s a pretty thin guy who doesn’t handle the ball that well and is an older prospect … Moving on from Tennessee, McRae has some of the tools to be an intriguing prospect, and could hear his name called in the 2nd round of the draft …

Great form, accuracy and confidence in his shot: Gets his feet set quickly, has a quick release, good elevation, follow through, and shows range and consistency … Does most of his damage offensively as a spot up shooter … Nearly 50% of his shots come from behind the 3point arch where he is extremely efficient (43% from 3)… Has improved his ability to attack the rim off the bounce and finish with dunks … A +6 or +7 length body type … His 7-foot wingspan allows him to get shots off with ease as well as being a difficult match up on the defensive end … Excels on the defensive end and is disruptive with his great length … Gets in a low defensive stance and covers a lot of ground making it difficult for opponents to get clean looks … Doesn’t gamble for steals and has learned to play sound, fundamental defense after 4 years under Jay Wright at Villanova. He plays the passing lanes well, and is tough to get shots off on due to his length … An extremely efficient overall offensive player shooting (51.6 fg%, 42.9% 3p, and 84.7% ft) … Has improved considerably in his junior season going from a key role player to a star (10 ppg to 18 PPG) on the college level and Villanova’s go-to athletic scorer … Has become known for being a clutch shooter, and seems to elevate his play in big moments … Level headed player who rarely loses his cool … Solid decision maker, 2.1/1.4 a/to rate … 
","The biggest knock on Bridges is his lack of strength. Not an overly physical player … His 2.8 FTs made on 3.4 attempts show that he doesn’t attack the rim and get to the line a great deal. His FTA/FGA ratio is below 30% at 28.0% … Has worked hard at adding muscle mass, but remains on the thin side at 210 lbs for a player about to turn 22. Could stand to add another 10 lbs, which would help him to finish through contact and play more physical at both ends. Though he may be a player that lacks the natural body type to carry more weight … He would also better utilize his great free throw shooting ability by playing more physical and attacking the rim … Playing alongside one of the nation’s best point guards (Jalen Brunson) for his entire college career has been a huge positive for Bridges, but it has also kept him from having to develop as an isolation player … Has displayed some ability to get to the rim off the bounce and pull up, but remains more of a catch and shoot guy than a driver (96.4% of his 3 pointers come off of assists) … Took some time to break into a star … Red-shirted the 2014-15 season, practicing with the team … Will turn 22 on August 30th, and therefore has maturity but less upside than a number of his fellow draft prospects… Foot speed is solid, especially laterally, but not exceptional … A good leaper but not great with contact and struggles some to finish after contact or rebound in traffic despite his length … Generally goes right, so could improve upon attacking off the dribble using his left hand … Vision and passing a work in progress. Not really a facilitator or a guy that creates open looks for teammates with the drive and dish … More of a lead by example type, could work on being more vocal now that he’s one of the team’s stars …

It remains to be seen if Craft can overcome his glaring shortcomings, but he is sure to work his butt off to make the most of whatever chance he gets in the NBA",Named National Defensive Player of the year by the NABC … Second Team All-Big Ten as a senior … 2014 First Team Academic All-American…,…,"Excellent on-ball defender with an incredible basketball IQ … Incredibly pesky defender whose on-ball pressure causes his man to make mistakes and turn the ball over … Very intelligent kid who knows exactly how to play the game.  Graduated with a 3.9 GPA after being the valedictorian of his high school class.  He’s almost like a coach on the floor … Makes all the little plays to help his team win … He hustles like few other prospects in this draft or any draft … Averaged 2.5 steals per game last season, which led the Big Ten by nearly half a steal.  He’s great at anticipating opponent’s passes and his quick hands knock the ball loose regularly.  His steals on the perimeter lead to lots of fast breaks, and Craft is great at leading the break as he can both finish and find teammates … Very good floor vision makes Craft a solid distributor.  He knows how to run an offense and keeps the ball moving on the perimeter … Good body control. Solid finisher … Decently quick first step and a set of good hesitation moves, although he’ll have more trouble getting by NBA defenders … Good at running the pick-and-roll … Plays great in the clutch and made several big shots throughout his career.  Hit a 3 in the final second to defeat Iowa State in last season’s NCAA Tournament …Craft is a strong point guard, which will help compensate for his lack of size and length … Good at creating offense as the inbounds passer.  Also has shown the ability to throw accurate long inbounds passes in time-sensitive situations (due in part to his background as a high school football quarterback) … Won 120 games at Ohio State.  The Buckeyes were in the Top 25 for most of his time there … Amazing work ethic will help Craft translate his game to the pro level … His teammates and classmates have nothing but great things to say about him … Has shown the ability to hit the three-pointer from time to time … All about winning.  Never about his own accolades … Constantly plays at maximum speed …
","Doesn’t have NBA measurable or athleticism.  He stands at under 6’2"" with a 6’2"" wingspan and has a poor vertical leap (32"") … Lacks a consistent outside shot …  Shot only 30% from distance last season and only attempted 1.5 three’s per game last season … His form is one of the worst you will find in an NBA prospect with a hitch that doesn’t appear to be fixable … This hurts his ability to space the floor and limits his options on the pick-and-roll as defenders disregard his shot and don’t step out on him … Does little offensively anywhere near an NBA level.  Craft never averaged more than 10 PPG in college … Yes, he’s unselfish, but that’s partially because he can’t create a lot offensively himself … His lack of size and athletic ability will slightly hamper his defensive ability at the next level, although his defensive effort will always make him a fairly effective defender … Craft plays at full speed all the time, but this makes him rather turnover-prone.  Turned it over 2.6 times per game last season and had an assist-to-turnover ratio of under 2:1 … He’s a smart player, but he’s not always smart with the ball … Drew under 4 free throws per game, and many of those were in the final minute when Ohio State was icing the clock away … Questionable shooting mechanics …

","Minimal offensive skills … Gets a high majority of his points off of simply catching and finishing. Isn’t always involved with the offense or has it run for him … Solid athlete, but not overly explosive, which diminishes his ability to some degree as a rim protector … Shows signs of facing up but has a ways to go before becoming a stretch big man … Post game is in its early stages of development.

Outlook: Oshae Brissett is a physical player who has a lot of raw skill but will need to improve a lot of aspects of his game in order to see any action in the NBA … Just based on his athletic gifts, Brissett could be a mid-late second rounder as teams could take a chance on him and stash him in the G-League for a few years as he matures … He will have to shoot better because he is not quite big enough to be a post-only player and he will need to space to use his athleticism and strength to drive into the lane … If he can develop a jump shot and look up while driving to the basket instead of throwing up bad shots, Brissett could be a decent interior-midrange scorer … If he can work at his shot, could end up a sleeper …

Also should focus on better follow through … Poor free throw shooter, who has never shot better than 65 percent in a season … Not particularly fluid running, sort of lumbers up and down the court with an uncoordinated looking gait, though not slow … Can be mistake prone for stretches of play … Has had a knack for picking up early and unnecessary fouls throughout his career … Plays with high intensity and a high motor, but can at times seem reckless or rushed … Definitely more of a developmental type of draft pick at the moment, though he is showing flashes of proficiency … 
Outlook: A physical specimen with great agility and athleticism that can switch between the 4 and the 5 positions at the next level … Will make his biggest impact on the defensive side where he will be an immediate paint presence … If he wants to be anything more than a third or fourth big, he will need to continue to work on becoming more of an offensive threat …

","He really needs to add strength, especially on his upper body… Very good, but not an elite athlete… The fact that he needs room to gather before jumping can be a problem at the next level… He might play inside the system, but this could make him look passive at times on offense… He needs to learn when to step up for his team… His free throw shooting was bad in 2016/17 season (below 60%), which is kind of bizzare considering he was shooting in the low 40’s from 3-point range… He doesn’t go to the line as often as you would expect from a guy with his skillset… Has the tendency to settle for mid-range and long range shots instead of going all the way to the basket… Has problems creating his own shot against athletic defenders… Seems to prefer to Pop out after he sets a screen rather than Roll hard to the basket…. He doesn’t establish position in the Post and can’t really exploit any miss-matches… His Post game is just average and doesn’t have enough counter moves… At times he tries to do too much with his ball in his hands, either by forcing a difficult pass or make one more dribble than he should, which leads to turnovers… There are moments he puts his hands down when he tries to block a shot and as a result he commits bad fouls… Holds his ground in the post on Defense, but he can’t really contain strong, physical players… Can lose focus on defense, and be too concern looking at the ball…
Overall: The rare combination of Stretch-4 potential and rim protection is what makes Jonah Bolden a really intriguing prospect. The Australian forward can become a “jack of all trades” kind of player on both ends of the floor, but for this to happen he has to be in the right system and continue to work hard.

Shows very good leadership and maturity, and figures to make an excellent teammate at the next level …
","Though a standout athlete with nice size, Toppin doesn’t seem to possess great foot quickness, and will likely have some struggles defending on the perimeter in match ups with quicker 4’s … Appears somewhat stiff in his upper body and shoulders, but flexibility could be improved upon over time  … Given his leaping skills and length, as well as the size advantage he enjoys in most matchups with A-10 big men, Toppin is an average overall rebounder at best (7.6 rpg this season, 5.8 rpg as a Fr) … Perhaps his rebounding can improve with focus on core strength, and work on fundamentals  … Though he’s been solid on defense in college, he does not project to be much of a shot blocker or threat in the passing lanes at the NBA level, giving him a unspectacular ceiling on that end of the floor … Doesn’t have many moves, as a low post player he prefers to almost exclusively use right handed jump hooks when he can’t simply dunk the ball, and he hasn’t showed much off the bounce when facing up either … Not much a shot creator … Turned 22 in March making him older than the average lottery pick … Though he proved to be a very good 3-point shooter, his 70% from the FT line is an area he needs to improve upon …
Overall: Toppin made a name for himself with his outstanding play in the last 2 seasons for a Dayton team that has a good track record of success as a “mid major” program … He led Dayton to a 29-2 record and 18-0 in conference … There is something to be said for a player who continually exceeds expectations after going from under the radar, to having a target on his back every night …Toppin was overlooked a year ago, having been denied an invite to the 2019 NBA Draft combine … He has some strong potential in the pick and roll/pop game, and is an efficient player with an intriguing combination of a good shooting stroke and above the rim athletic ability …He’s currently not much off the dribble, is a surprisingly mediocre rebounder and his lateral quickness is somewhat questionable for a 4 man, but he is a hard-working, efficient player who has more strengths than weaknesses and figures to be among the first players to come off the board on draft night … Has made it known that he would love to join the Golden State Warriors who go into the lottery with the best chance of landing the top pick and at worst will be drafting fifth … Figures to be drafted somewhere in the top half of the lottery … Has All Star potential if his offensive game continues to develop and he lands in a good situation …

","Lacks length.

Outlook: Projects to be a serviceable bench player to spot starter early in his career with the ability to develop into a reliable scorer at the next level … May never be good enough defensively to fill the 3 and D role, but rapid development in college suggests the ability to carve out an important role on a good team … Is often viewed as just a shooter, but can score in a variety of ways and should be able to translate that portion of his game to the NBA … Could play a Richard Hamilton type role offensively for a number of teams, albeit with a significantly smaller usage rate … The added spacing of an NBA offense should open up his offense beyond what he was able to show at Kentucky … Lack of versatility could limit him as he isn’t a ball handler, but his offensive ability could really impress teams in pre-draft workouts …

He also has an advanced mid-range game and can play on or off the ball, showing legit point guard skills. Has good instincts and high basketball IQ. Has excellent length with a 6-10 wingspan. A versatile defender who can guard 3 positions and plays with an edge. Herro is a solid rebounder and has good size at 6-6 that will allow him to contribute on the glass as a guard. Herro is a terrific shot maker, but he also is a solid scorer anywhere on the court off the catch and shoot or off the dribble. His scoring off the dribble improved throughout the season. Herro’s playmaking is also underrated, as he posted close to a 2:1 assist to turnover ratio. Herro’s also has plenty of upside as a defender with his size, length and above-average athleticism. He has solid anticipation, averaging a steal per game in his freshman season. He is a solid distributing guard that has the potential to become an above average 3&D player in the NBA.
","Herro can make shots in a multitude of ways, but he can be very inconsistent with his shot. He has a tendency to force the issue and not distribute the ball at times. He has the potential to become an elite 3-point shooter and above average defender in this league, but he must be willing to adapt when his shot is not falling. He also must improve his pace as he can at times play too fast and be out of control. He does not have elite athleticism, so when Herro does guard elite athletic two guards it becomes a challenge. Could struggle to guard against NBA quickness. Doesn’t project as a player who can get to the rim with constancy at the NBA level and will have a hard time getting separation. Lacks lower body strength. Doesn’t get off the floor very well and isn’t an above the rim player.

","The biggest question will be on the defensive end as he lacks ideal length and in particular foot speed … At 6’7 and not that much bigger of a wingspan (6’8) he won’t possess the quickness and length to stay in front of and check NBA small forwards, nor the length or physicality to match the power forwards… 8’5 standing reach is good for a shooting guard, but small at the 3 position … His toughness will help him initially but over time he will have to figure out how to overcome his defensive deficiencies… Offensively, to become elite he’ll have to improve his vision and playmaking skills for his teammates, otherwise he’ll put himself in a situation where he may be valued only as a spot-up shooter … A good but not great shooter, but could improve as time goes on considering his level of dedication … Shot 77% from the free throw line, which is solid but if shooting is his forte, he’ll need to raise that … 
Outlook: The Lithuanian born-Canadian raised athlete has offensive skills that could land him a spot on an NBA roster for multiple years … Landing on a roster that plays small lineups should benefit him, especially on the defensive end where coaches will have an easier time finding him the right matchup… He will have to expand his game offensively in order to become a quality scorer in the league, but at only 20 years old he’ll have time …

","Devonte Graham, while possessing decent size and length, is still a little thin for an NBA guard … Listed at 185 pounds, he could stand to add some strength … Athletically he’s average, showing good quickness, and the ability to get off the ground, but he’s not a standout by NBA standards … Could be taken out of games mentally if he gets frustrated … A poor shooting start in games potentially means he will stop looking for shots and instead look to distribute the ball instead … This strategy, while unselfish, often hurt the Jayhawks who at times struggled to find scoring during 2017-18 … Only shot .40% from the floor in his senior season, but this is more due to the massive offensive burden he took on for the Jayhawks … I suspect his shot selection will improve in the professional ranks when he’s not asked to do so much for his team … While showing improvement every season in college, Graham turned 23 years old in February and therefore is likely not to be viewed as a player with much upside left to develop … His age is likely to effect his draft stock … 
Overall: Devonte Graham is an experienced point guard with a high level shot from outside … He can play on or off the ball, is adept in the pick and roll, and has the maturity to needed for professional basketball … Those things alone make him an appealing player to look at to help add depth to your lineup … He’s a player of average positional size and athleticism … That paired with his age will hurt where he get selected, but many prospects in this draft don’t have the amount of NBA translatable skills Graham possesses … A likely role player, Devonte will certainly be in the mix in the 2nd round this season, and has the ability to stick with a team given the right opportunity …

","Multiple knee surgeries including two ACL tears (both knees) and an MCL tear (left) before graduating high school is a huge question mark with regards to the outlook of Giles’ career.  No team wants to draft the next Greg Oden and players with injury histories like that of Giles always raise red flags to scouts and GM’s who are putting their jobs on the line with every draft pick and free agent signing …  His ability to explode with contact seemed affected … As far as Giles’ looks on the court, he seemed to get lost at times during his freshman season and was almost afraid to do certain things … Whether that was simply due to a fear of another injury, lack of conditioning, Duke’s struggles in developing bigs, or an awareness thing remains to be seen … He isn’t a versatile player on offense and doesn’t really possess the range that you would like to see out of a PF even though that was always was he projected to be during his days in high school …  Doesn’t have great footwork or great touch on offense and relies heavily on put backs and dunks for most of his points …  His jumper is one glaring hole in his game as he routinely air balled or barely drew iron once outside of about 12 feet …  Doesn’t make great decisions on offense and hasn’t really learned to simply play within himself just yet …

Overall: Giles’ freshman season wasn’t what most had hoped it would be …  He had a hard time getting into shape post knee surgeries and never really carved out the type of roll that you would have hoped for a player with his skill set …  His 3.9 point and 3.8 rebound averages are more synonymous with a player who would likely go undrafted as opposed to one that is likely to go in the first round.  There were definitely flashes of the player that he used to be but he was never really fully healed during his time at Duke … Will have to learn to trust his knees and believe that he is healthy before he will make an impact at the next level … Would likely have been the #1 overall pick this year if it weren’t for the impact his injuries had on his senior year in high school and freshman year with the Blue Devils … His feel for the game was off during the year but he gets a pass in my book due to the fact that he was getting acclimated to high level college basketball after missing so much time due to injuries over the previous three years … If Giles’ injuries are a thing of the past and he can stay healthy then he could be the steal of the draft if he falls into the late teens to early 20’s.

","The knocks against Williams are obvious.  First off, he played in a small conference, so his inflated numbers are to be taken with several grains of salt as he accrued by dominating a bunch of smaller, weaker guys … Second, he is basically an undersized center, so at the NBA level, he will be asked to play the 4 … Though he has decent length, he still isn’t tall or long enough to guard NBA centers, but his lack of mobility and shooting range may limit him at the 4 … Finally, conditioning could be a concern as he is one of the biggest guys in this draft class.  His body fat percentage, 12% isn’t horrible, but it’s probably going to limit him in the NBA.  He played a high volume of minutes in college, but he was often slow to get back in transition and the pace of the NBA game is faster…Williams’ jump shot is pretty limited.  He’s got a soft touch within about 5 feet of the basket, but from mid-range and beyond, he’s not much of a threat … Somewhat slow-footed.  Had the slowest time in the shuttle run at the NBA Combine.  In game, he has a fair amount of a agility, as far as natural footspeed and explosiveness, he is lacking and that will be much more exposed in the NBA … Also had the second-lowest max vertical at the combine.  Not a good combination with his limited height…
Overall: Williams was dominant in college, but the big question is, how will his skills translate from the Big West to the big leagues?  He has shown excellent rebounding and scoring abilities (against inferior competition), as well as great instincts and high basketball IQ, which translate to any level … He’s undersized and slow and his conditioning isn’t great and he doesn’t have much more growth and development left to do, but he’s also strong and powerful and will certainly get looks based off of his production at the D-I level alone.

Overall: Allen burst onto the scene after scoring 16 points to help Duke win the 2015 National Title game as a little used Freshman off the bench, and went on to have a storied career in Durham …I’m going to go out on a limb and say Grayson Allen has been the most polarizing player in the country, for one of the most polarizing programs in the country the past 4 seasons …  He has some character concerns that have been addressed during the draft process, not to mention some areas throughout his game that need work, but not many played through as much public adversity as Allen did (even though he caused most, if not all of it himself) … Owns a skill set that can be honed into production as a bench shooter/scorer at the next level, and he has shown that he is capable of playing in the bright lights at times, but he has to work on his overall consistency and show he has the mental toughness to make it … It is possible that he is selected in the late 1st round, but he could be picked in the 2nd round as well

","Buddy’s main knock will be his height for an NBA shooting guard, and although he’s improved his handle significantly in order to become more of a combo guard, he’s still not more of an undersized 2 … Buddy handles the ball a lot, and carries a great offensive burden for the Sooners, as a result he can be turnover prone at times (10 TO’s vs Oklahoma State) … Buddy has clearly worked to improve his game off the dribble, and now takes less than 50% of his shots from deep, in favor of driving to the hoop to keep defenders guessing … In reality, this is a player who has clearly worked very hard at not just what he does well, but his flaws, and as a result, he’s become a very complete player, that’s hard to nitpick outside of some physical differences between the size of NCAA players and those in the NBA …
Overall: Hield is one of the elite players in college basketball this season, and he’s done so by improving his game tremendously throughout his four years … This kind of work ethic, and the results on the court present a huge draw when looking to draft a player … He’s an NBA ready 3 point marksman, and scorer, and an emerging ball handler, who is clearly looking to become a more versatile combo guard at the next level … He doesn’t have great size for the NBA, but his wingspan, athletic ability, and drive compensate for not being 6’6’’… I feel Hield has real potential in the NBA to score the basketball, and very early in his career … His ceiling will be dictated on if and when he feels comfortable running an NBA offense … If Buddy can keep improving, he has a very high ceiling, if Buddy’s current model is closer to his peak, then I feel he’s still a lottery worthy NBA draft pick …

Hield is also a strong ball handler, who is capable of driving and getting his own shot at the rim … His 62.5% FG clip at the rim in 2013-14 is good for a 6’4.5’’ player, and he’s got a quick enough first step to translate to the NBA … Hield is a good creator for a SG, as well … As a soph, he dished out a respectable 1.9 apg despite playing next to a pure point guard, Jordan Woodard, in Norman … A low turnover player as well, his 1.8 TO pg is a good sign coming from a player who has the ball in his hands as much as he does … Heild is an average defensive rebounder, as he is often out on the perimeter, but he’s good at crashing the offensive glass and getting 2nd opportunities … Of his 4.4 rebounds per game, 1.8 were offensive which is a really nice number for a guard … He’s a solid defender, who’s length, and strength can give opponents trouble, and while he won’t be as big comparatively in the NBA, he has the tools to hold his own and be an effective defender … 
","Buddy is a little short for a shooting guard, as previously mentioned, and although he’s made some major strides, especially as an overall offensive player, he’s yet to really develop his mid-range game … In 2013-14, Hield only shot 29.6% on 2 point jumpers, and he’s yet to really maximize his driving ability … Its no surprise when talking about such a high volume shooter, that over 50% of Buddy’s shots came in the form of 3 pointers, and although he’s a good shooter from that range, he can sometimes settle … His junior year, he’s really lived and died by the 3 ball, which includes a 7-7, 25 point performance, and a 1-8, 5 point performance … This tendency can render him a bit predictable, and despite being a very good scorer, he needs to expand his offensive game or he could be pigeon holed as a long range specialist … 
Overall: Buddy Hield is a great long range gunner with a strong physique and the athletic ability, length and strength to play the 2 spot in the NBA. Despite being a tad short, he made major strides between his freshman and sophomore seasons, and another jump could help his overall perception … Already a major NCAA producer, he has some good skills that kind of took a back seat to his shooting last year, and if he were to tap into them and expand his offensive strategy,  it could make a major difference …

","Ejim’s unique hodgepodge of skills combine to make him a player lacking a true position … His build and limited post ability are reminiscent of a power forward, but he doesn’t have nearly the size or the well-developed post game to be a true power forward … He does, however, have a great deal of athleticism, but his lack of quickness and ball-handling ability limit him as a perimeter player … His first step is not very good, which is a shame considering his finishing ability.  He often needs to get the ball close to the hoop to be able to make use of his ability to fight through contact … His lack of quickness also causes him to sometimes struggle to stay in front of his man on the perimeter, although his strength helps alleviate this concern … For a forward, his ball-handling ability is quite limited and he struggles to create his own shot on the perimeter … Since so much of his game is predicated on going to work inside and cutting to the basket, then getting fed the ball, Ejim could potentially struggle in the NBA as he faces bigger interior defenders … Ejim benefited greatly from playing with Kane and Niang, who were often the two best passers on the court.  When he reaches the NBA, the defense will be less susceptible and he may not have the benefit of playing with a superior setup man … His range is still a little shaky and he’s a passable, but not huge threat from the outside … Another facet of his game that will be limited in the pros is his rebounding.   Once again, the level of athleticism, size, and fundamentals will prevent him from dominating on the boards as he did as a 6’6"" forward at the college level …

Overall: Sort of a forgotten man who some scouts felt could be a first rounder with a good sophomore year … Age and lack of production will cost him on draft day … Brown Jr has upside as a player who can defend either guard spot, and even some smaller SF’s … He is a good athlete with some nice physical attributes due to his length and body strength, and he is an active player who rebounds at a very good rate for a perimeter player … The outrageous dropoff in his shooting numbers are a discouraging problem though, as he was only a middling shooter the season before too (34 down to 26% from 3) … Add in his season-ending foot injury prematurely ending his season and the momentum he built as a prospect as a freshman had worsened … Still, considering he has a chance to carve a niche as a potential defense-first wing, it makes his chances of being selected in the draft and sticking greater  …

","A late bloomer in regards to his physical frame as he’s still a bit on the thin side … Still very much a kid and will require additional time to fully mature both on and off the floor … Would benefit from developing more muscle/strength for the next level (especially in the upper body) … He’s not overly bouncy or explosive … His overall offensive game is still unpolished despite the promise it has … Jackson has a tendency to get into foul trouble (averaged 8.6 fouls per 100 possessions … A lot of his fouls stem from him being undisciplined on defense … Foul trouble was a main reason why his playing time was diminished throughout his FR season … Needs to work on maintaining his balance as a low-post defender … May need to tweak his shooting mechanics (low release, knuckleball), but still projects as a solid outside shooter … Although he shot a high percentage throughout the season, he did attempt just seven shots per game (what will he do with an expanded role?) … Needs to polish his shooting off the dribble … He was too passive and therefore inconsistent at times … Not an elite below-the-rim finisher … Needs to learn how to move onto the next play (maturity) and not check out the game (mentally) when he makes a bad play or something doesn’t go his way … Lacks passing awareness … Doesn’t look comfortable making decisions with the ball … Remains to be seen if he can develop into a playmaker … His assist-to-turnover ratio left a lot to be desired … Not a shifty enough ball-handler in traffic … Can be a little wild and out of control when he puts the ball on the floor … Does not have a go-to move in the post that he can rely upon … Still developing the footwork that’ll be necessary as a viable low-post threat against bigger and stronger players in the NBA … 
Overall: Jackson is perhaps the best two-way big man to come out of this year’s draft and has enormous upside … He’s developed rapidly in one season under Tom Izzo at Michigan State … In the modern NBA, Jackson’s skillset is what is in demand from big men … He’s a complete big man who can shoot from deep, protect the rim and has no problem switching out to guards in the pick-and-roll or isolation … He just didn’t get a chance to really show the full range of his value on a consistent basis with the Spartans … He averaged just 21.8 minutes per game, and much of the reasoning behind that is because he was so foul prone (he also was the fifth option on most nights) … Jackson thoroughly contemplated returning to school for his sophomore year in order to show that he was capable of a larger role and averaging the 20-10 numbers that his contemporaries (DeAndre Ayton & Marvin Bagley III) put up throughout the season. But scouts and other NBA personnel don’t need to see another year of him in Spartans uniform to know that he has a ton of promise on both ends of the floor … One thing to note about Jackson is that he’s just scratching the surface of his abilities and is still realizing how good he can become … He’s built a strong case for top-5 consideration in this year’s draft, though he will probably require more patience than some of the other elite prospects …

","No real defined role offensively yet … A little bit stiff in his movements and running the floor … Thick legs … Doesn’t always exhibit an ideal level of intensity … Needs to work on his ability to create shots … Shot mechanics need some fine tuning as he has a bit of a slow release and seems to telegraph his shot too often … His motion gets sped up if a defender is too close to him … Shoots with minimal arc and not much rotation … Only shot 52 percent from the free throw line … Is not a strong ball handler, dribbles high and away from body … Can be very loose with the ball, especially with his off hand … Does not create his own offense … Won’t be an instant facilitator at the next level … Has trouble recognizing the open player as a playmaker … His effort was very up-and-down during his stint at Indiana … While he has the tools to become a quality defender, was slow at times reacting on defense … Late-bloomer so his basketball IQ needs some catching up …  Post skills are extremely raw and in need of refinement … While he shows solid attributes and potential as a rebounder, remains extremely unproven having averaged 2.6 and 5.4 rebounds per game over his FR and SO seasons … Is recovering from a torn ACL suffered in late January, which could cloud his draft stock … 
Outlook: Hoping to capitalize on the substantial internet hype that he had generated, Anunoby entered the 2017 draft and signed with an agent, despite a disappointing season in which he suffered a torn ACL … After shutting down Kentucky freshman Jamal Murray in the Round of 32 in the 2016 NCAA Tournament, Anunoby became a hot name and one to watch for in the 2017 draft class … His numbers saw an uptick, but with his struggles in getting clean looks, his game didn’t change much before he ultimately went down with an injury … Had Tom Crean kept his job at IU, Anunoby likely would be back in Bloomington, IN … However, with him being young for his class (won’t turn 20 until September) and possessing the body and athletic profile that he does, he certainly possesses a lot of intrigue to teams … A bit of a tweener as he lacks a polished skill set, especially offensively at either forward position … At this point he’s a project, coming off a major injury … With proper development, Anunoby could become a valued asset in the modern NBA game …

","Not a bad athlete by any means but not the explosive type of guy that you would want out of a potential lottery pick … He’s going to play on the wing at the next level and will be going up against the league’s best when it comes to that category … His aforementioned wingspan would rank in the bottom third of the league at 6’5 … Lacks explosiveness at the rim and is more of a crafty scorer than a guy that is going to get into the lane, absorb a ton of contact and get to the free throw line … Moves his feet well on defense but can get burned by quicker players on the perimeter … Will need to be in a good defensive scheme with better individual defenders around him to be effective on that end of the floor … Had an extremely poor showing in the NCAA Tournament as Duke fell short of expectations as they fell to South Carolina in the Round of 32 …
Overall: Few players in the entire NCAA did more for their draft stock this season than Kennard … Coming into the 2016-2017 season he was considered a solid role player and a guy who might get some draft consideration in 2018 or 2019.  Led the ACC in scoring during the regular season.  Lot to love about his game one the offensive end and a lot to be desired on the defensive end.  Kennard is just one of those guys who ""gets it"" and knows how to play the game.  Rarely gets out of control and seemingly does whatever he needs to for his team to win on any given night.  He will be one of those guys who surprises people at the next level and should stick around in the league for quite some time due to his overall skill set and versatility on offense.

","Keenan really is more of a 6’3” shooting guard with good ball handling skills … His position at the NBA level will be a point guard, and while the current style of play in the NBA gives combo guards a better chance of sticking than they did 20 years ago, his passing skills leave something to be desired … Evans averaged just 3.2 assists per contest as a senior, and while his 1.9 TO’s per game as a primary ball handler is a low number, it’s well below the 2.0+ assist to TO ratio ideal for point guard prospects … One thing Keenan can improve upon is the quickness of his release … He has the tendency to cock the ball back and this results in a slower release … Against larger, and longer defenders, he’ll need to improve on this to get off his jump shot … He kind of lacks a stand out skill … There are plenty of 6′ 2”-6′ 4” combo guards who scored at a high level in college, but what is his calling card? … Evans’ ability to find a spot in the NBA will have to be dictated on a team being an ideal fit for his game and personality …  
Overall: Keenan Evans is an experienced combo guard with a tough nosed mentality and a knack for making big shots … He’s bested Trae Young and Devonte Graham in individual matchups, and lead his team to an Elite 8 birth … He leaves a little to be desired in terms of playmaking, and defensive versatility, but he’s a quick player with respectable athletic ability and a creative scoring repertoire … It’d be a bonus if he could improve the quickness of his release on his jumper … He could sneak into the late 2nd round in June, but most likely is a player who will have to earn his keep as a rookie free agent … His toughness is a quality that coaches love, so it may just be finding the right fit in order for him to stick …

","Although Anigbogu has an impressive combination of physical tools, his overall skillset has a great deal of catching up to do … His touch around the basket can be a bit erratic, as most of his scoring comes off of putbacks and lob passes … He’s also not nearly as explosive of a leaper in traffic, and he doesn’t have the awareness to consistently know when to kick the ball out and reset the possession … He will often force tough shots with little to no chance of converting … This can be seen through the fact that he shot only 48% on field goal attempts after offensive rebounds  … Even though he is an explosive athlete in space, when contested by an equal athlete, his lack of touch becomes an issue … It will be important for him to improve in this area, especially considering the jump in interior talent he’ll be facing in the NBA … He could also stand to improve his hands, as he struggles to catch passes thrown below his chest … In terms of perimeter skill level, Anigbogu still has much work to do. He attempted just eight jump shots on the season, and looked very mechanical when doing so … There isn’t a whole lot of fluidity in his jump shot, and his 53.5% shooting from the free-throw line suggests that he does not have great upside as a stretch forward … Anigbogu is similarly unrefined in the post … Despite his size and strength, he shot just 30.4% on post-up opportunities, despite using a sizable portion of his half-court offense on the block … His lack of touch again comes into play here, but his unrefined footwork is a big factor in his ineffectiveness as well … Anigbogu can become predictable in the post, as he is limited to mostly simple jump hooks and turnarounds … His hands are not secure and he fumbles away far too many easy catches and rebounds … He also becomes very turnover prone when doubled in the post, turning the ball over on nearly 18% of his post-up possessions, which is nearly as often as the 25% at which he scores … Another issue he has is that he can be too aggressive in seeking out opportunities to block shots … Anigbogu has a tendency to find himself out of position as he chases shots he has little to no chance of getting to … While his constant motor and activity level are things to be valued, he’ll have to work on harnessing his aggression and continue to develop his overall recognition, awareness, and communication defensively in order to make the most of his physical gifts … His 7.6 fouls for per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, say a lot about his lack of defensive discipline … Even though it takes six fouls in the NBA before disqualification, he will need to improve in this area to stay on the court for longer stretches … One more area he could improve on is on the defensive glass, as he hauled in just 19.9% of the available defensive rebounds while he was on the court … His activity as a shot blocker hinders him somewhat in this regard, but his overall awareness can get better … He is capable of rebounding out of his area because of his physical tools, but he needs to do a better job of being in position to haul in defensive rebounds …

Seems to be wired to put as much attention on that end as on offense … He has excellent physical tools … He really anchored Washington’s 2-3 zone … Can put the ball on the floor and attack the rim. Can throw it down with ease … Really dangerous in the open floor … Capable of making open threes, just needs to get more consistent … Plays with a lot of energy. Has a good motor … Solid overall free throw shooting and three point numbers in junior year lead to optimism about his offensive potential … Considered one of the draft’s top individuals off the court … 
","Needs to get more comfortable on offense … Sometimes forces things a bit … Shooting needs to improve. Lacks consistency … Has the ability to make threes, but not yet at a consistent rate … Great defender, but his offense needs to catch up … Ball handling needs to improve; handle is a bit loose … While his defensive numbers improved over his career, his shooting from the field actually regressed from his junior year to his senior year … As a junior, he averaged 11.2 points per game on 44.5% shooting from the field and 36.5% shooting from 3-point range … As a senior he averaged 9.1 points per game on 41.5% shooting from the field and 30.5% shooting from 3-point range. Foul shooting has been an overall strength of his (78.2%) for his career, but it has been very up and down at the same time. 71.4% as a freshman and as a junior. 84.1% as a sophomore and 85.1% as a senior …  
Overall: There’s a lot to like about Thybulle from a defensive standpoint … He blocks shots and gets steals at a phenomenal clip and with improved offensive abilities has the potential to be a really good two-way player in the NBA … If his offense can improve, the sky is the limit to what he can accomplish … If his offense remains shaky, he projects to be much more of a defensive specialist … He’s one of those players where fit matters a lot … He needs to get with a team that is able to utilize his unique skillsets and be patient with him as he develops … He’ll probably need to spend some time in the G-League, underscoring the importance of finding that right fit …

","Very limited offensively.  He can get to the basket and he can finish above the rim, but he has very few post moves, nor does he have any kind of range on his jumper … Might be more inclined to play center, but at 6’10"", he doesn’t have the size to do so, and as is, may get pushed off the block at times guarding NBA 4’s … This could very well be indicative of an inability to make the transition to matching up with NBA bigs, as his athleticism and decent size won’t be nearly as big of an advantage … Statistically, Auguste is a good rebounder, but that skill may not translate as well as NBA defenders may have a much easier time boxing him out … Often plays too passively on the offensive end, although he made an impact much more consistently this past season…Not a particularly sound defender, either in the post, or on the perimeter…Will turn 23 in July, which is very undesirable for a man his size…
Overall: Struggled against teams with NBA size and talent, as evidenced by subpar performances against Duke, Virginia, Iowa, and his last two games against UNC …  Auguste is a skilled and athletic power forward who can put the ball on the floor and finish above the rim, but his post skills are a bit lacking and his age will definitely be a factor working against him.  His chances of being selected are slim, but despite his advanced age for a big man prospect, he could yet develop into a serviceable NBA 4 thanks to his unique skillset…

","While a polished and athletic guard, the first thing that comes up with a player like Jerian is how much left does he have to improve … He’ll turn 23 before his first NBA game, and although I feel he’s not done developing, some may feel he lacks the ceiling of a younger player … Grant also got off to a hot start his junior year from beyond the arc before sitting out the second half of the season for academic reasons … Despite an early .408% clip, he regressed as a senior, and shot a pretty unimpressive .316% from downtown … Although Grant has good shooting ability, many of these shots were not quality shots, often coming off the dribble … He needs to adjust both his long range shot selection, and just gain more deep reps when looking towards the next level … He is also viewed as a combo guard of sorts, which isn’t a huge deal because of his positional size, if he is indeed a point guard, then he’s huge, but if he’s an off guard with some point skills, he doesn’t have that same advantage and intrigue … Improving upon the ability to set up others in the pick and roll will be important to his future … 
Overall: Jerian Grant could help just about any team from day 1, he’s a smart, well rounded player with highlight-reel hops (ask Tadrick Jackson), and NBA level skills at the point … His development in college leads me to believe he still has some room for growth, and his athletic ability and size is top notch … Today you’d like your guards to be a little better shooting from distance, but with some reps paired with getting used to his role in the NBA game, that could be something Grant could develop … Despite his age Grant is most definitely a first round talent, and could be a real sleeper if teams underestimate what he can do, in favor of focusing on the year he was born …

","Dotson has some solid potential on defense, but he will need to improve his strength, to hold up against bigger NBA guards and wings … Scouts also question if he will be able to bring anything else to the table offensively other than spot up shooting … Creating offense via off the dribble or in the pick and roll is not one of his strengths … Also a hefty 84.5% of his field goal attmepts were jump shots, which is not an efficient way to score in the NBA … If his jumper is not working, there is concern that he will be of almost no value when on the floor because of this high rate … In addition he got to the free throw line only 1.7 times per game last season, a testament to his heavy dose of jump shot selection … While he showed glimpses of passing ability in pre-draft workouts, he averaged a pedestrian 1.5 assists per-40 minutes in his career, so there are question marks about why he never was a high level facilitator in his college career … He also needs to make some strides on his off the ball defense … He takes poor angles when chasing cutters on the perimeter, and he has a tendency to be out of control when closing out to shooters … He is also already 23 years old, so there is not a lot of time for him to develop or prove himself in the league … He will need to establish himself relatively quickly if he wants to stick in the NBA …

May need time to grow and mature, develop a better feel for the game, defensive spacing, etc. He will likely gain confidence and develop a swagger in time … The truth is he’s a great kid who’s just naive, like most 20 year olds … As one scout put it, ""Just imagine what he’ll be like when he gets some confidence and hits his stride"" … Had one dreadful performance against North Carolina (2 pts 0-9 fg) during their tourney run in which he disappeared and somewhat crumbled under the pressure, and detractors point to this game as proof that he lacks a killer instinct or the ""alpha dog"" personality. In reality the same criticisms could be made about Bradley Beal for ""running from the basketball"" in the key minutes of Florida’s loss to Louisville in the NCAA tournament. McLemore bounced back with 20 pts on 8-15 in their next and last game vs. Michigan … Sometimes the moment overcomes players and only a fool would judge a player based on one college performance … Needs to work on his ISO game, become a better ball handler and not be so careless turning the ball over … Where McLemore struggled defensively was in isolation, showing a need to expand his feel for the game, focus on fundamentals, get lower and not bite on fakes as heavily. Shows solid effort, he just needs to make a better effort of getting low, anticipating, and not allowing opponents to get by him on penetration … Had an extremely tough upbringing so there are some concerns about how he will be able to handle immediate riches … Two years at Kansas were crucial for his maturity and long term development off the court, but has a bigger adjustment curve than the average prospect and needs time and patience from the team that invests a pick in him …

He’ll definitely need to improve his 3-point shooting and foul shooting in order to reach his full potential … Very right hand dominant … Finishes almost exclusively with his right hand … Needs to improve his finishing ability with his off hand … Has the tendency to either force himself to finish right or go up with two hands … The thing he needs to most focus on is becoming a more consistent shooter and also adding some bulk … 190 pounds is pretty light for an NBA player … Lastly, having missed his sophomore season at USC, he’s a bit of gamble in that it’s unclear how much better he has gotten since his freshman year … If he wants to raise his draft stock, he’s going to have to really ball out in pre-draft workouts and at the combine …

","While he does in large part make up for it with his high-IQ and skill, Shamet’s lack of burst off the dribble will limit his upside at the next level … At the college level, it does not hinder him that often, but in the NBA he will be up against much more explosive and skilled guards every single night … Shamet also still has some developing to do, physically, in order to reach his full potential … He will need to add some strength and muscle in order for him to endure a full NBA season and withstand the physicality of the pro game … While he is a very good finisher at the basket in college, it will be much more difficult to replicate in the NBA without him adding a few pounds of muscle, especially since he does not have elite explosiveness to compensate for it … There will also be questions about what to do with Shamet defensively at the next level … While he has the size and length to challenge point guards, he struggles to stay in front of quicker players … He may have to be a guy that relies on his length to come up with steals and blocks in order to at least be semi-productive on the defensive end … However, forcing turnovers or contesting shots has never been a true strength of his … Shamet has also had multiple foot injuries throughout his career, so there may be concerns of whether that will continue to be an issue going forward …

","While Jevon Carter is a fearless player I wouldn’t choose to bet against, length projects to be an issue for him at the next level … Despite a nice wingspan and good leaping ability, his 7’11” standing reach was one of the lowest measured at the NBA combine … His grit and skill as a defender will serve him well in the NBA, but larger NBA points will most certainly be able to shoot over him … Length also bothered him finishing around the rim at the collegiate level … Carter shot 50% at the rim (according to Hoop-Math) his senior season at West Virginia, and converting in the lane will only get harder in the league … Getting his shot off on the perimeter will be harder too, and he’ll have to be more crafty to create more space between himself and a longer defender … Jevon will also turn 23 before his first NBA game giving him the label as a player with limited upside … 
Overall: Jevon Carter is a tough nosed collegiate veteran with the ability to shoot from the outside and pester opposing point guards … While not a high upside player, nor a guy with great length, Carter has NBA translatable skills and the ability to carve out a role for himself as a reserve guard … He’s a solid athlete with excellent conditioning, and a track record of winning basketball games while improving his game every year … Probably a guy in the mix in the second round, but also a guy who could see minutes as a rookie depending on the team that selects him.

","Despite being very young and showing a lot of ability, it’s possible that his ceiling isn’t quite as high as some believe … While he’s got a great attitude and appears very coachable, there’s skepticism whether he has the swagger to take his game to a star level … At the moment he doesn’t have any post moves to create for himself or be major a threat offensively and his free throw shooting was amongst the worst of any draft prospect … It begs the question of how big an impact he will be on the offensive end, and also without teammates creating for him … Defensively he should look to become a little nastier in pushing people around on the block … At this point his skills as a rim protector are underdeveloped, and it may never be a strength to his game … While he is really good at bodying people up and blocking shots on ball, he needs to learn how to contest shots coming from help side as well as being better against guards driving to the rim … Overall Poeltl has certainly made the best of his year and deserved the hype considering how fast he developed … Though his developing a real post game remains a questionmark, and that could always keep him away from becoming a high level NBA center …
Outlook: After such a productive freshman year and showing a lot of promise with his great size, fluidity and solid touch, Poeltl is considered a likely first rounder by NBA scouts if he enters the 2015 NBA draft …

Measured 6’11 (in shoes) 219 lbs, with a 7’4 wingspan at the 2011 LeBron James Skills Academy. Never averaged more than 19 minutes per game for an entire season, but finished 11th all-time in Blocked shots in the Big 12. ",5/9/16,"Despite playing a limited role his first three seasons has been on the NBA radar for quite some time due to his immense physical gifts … Standing 6’11’’ in shoes, he sports a massive 7’5.5’’ wingspan and a standing reach of 9’4.5’’. Not only does Ibeh have great size for an NBA big man, not to mention he also weighs in at a well-muscled 260 pounds … He is a quick leaper, with good lateral quickness, and solid end to end speed … Even at the NBA level his athleticism is above average …  Prince regularly finished alley oops well above the rim, and has strong hands … The reigning Big 12 Defensive player of the year, Ibeh showed great timing both guarding the rim, and blocking shots coming over from the help side. He blocked 2.4 shots in just 22.3 minutes in Big 12 play (in which he took over starting duties for the injured Cam Ridley). In addition to the shots he connected on, he altered many more, and he actually did a pretty good job of keeping blocks in play … Many times his swats would lead to fast break opportunities on the other end for the Longhorns, and when they were launched out of play, there was a clear shift in momentum. His pure athleticism, size, and defensive ability are his main appeal at the next level … Only a good defensive rebounder, he did a great job of picking up offensive boards for Texas last season. In Big 12 play, he hauled in 2.7 offensive boards per contest which ranked 4th in the conference during league play … Per 40 minutes, Ibeh would have nabbed 4.8 offensive misses. He’s also young for his class. Despite playing 4 years in college, he won’t turn 22 until June 3rd. 
","A massive project. Prince doesn’t have a great natural feel for the game, and although his physical gifts make him an intriguing defensive option, he’s pretty much just an oop target, and garbage man on offense … Like many athletically gifted big men, he’s a horrid free throw shooter … In 4 seasons for Texas Ibeh shot just .432% on his career and showed little improvement if any during his time in Austin … He’s also not very polished on the block which can be evident when he doesn’t have a clear path to the bucket … He can be prone to missing a bunny over now and then due to a lack of touch … Not a great defensive rebounder for a player with his gifts, can be caught out of position when fighting for defensive boards … Ibeh can be foul prone at times, but will also benefit from the more wide open NBA style …
Overall: Athletic specimens like Prince Ibeh don’t come along every day. He’s an amazing combination of size, length, muscle, and spring … He has the potential to be a disruptive force on the defensive end on an NBA roster pretty early in his career. He has almost no feel for the game in the ball in his hands, but he’s also a pretty low mistake player on offense because he so rarely gets the ball. Often big athletic guys have more success in the NBA than they did in college, so Prince remains an intriguing option, even knowing he could not stick in the league. Even though he has a long way to go, Ibeh’s natural gifts make him a swing for the fence option in the 2nd round.

He can be a bit over aggressive at times defending closeouts, but he has the length to recover and alter shots at the rim even after being beat off the dribble … He can cover a lot of ground with his mobility and length from both inside and out. As he continues to mature and understand defensive positioning, he will become an absolute force on this side of the floor … He also has the ability to be a weapon on the offensive glass, especially finding second chance points off of put backs … He has the size and explosiveness to corral the ball off the rim, and he is a quick jumper … Adding a little more to his offensive skillset and becoming more physical in the paint will be the main variables in determining if he reaches his full potential … Comanche is a little more raw than your average 20-year old, but he possesses some unique characteristics that can’t be taught, so it will be interesting to see if his production can begin to catch up to his potential …
","Despite his plus length, one of the biggest knocks on Comanche is his lack of strength … Weighing just 215 pounds, this weakness was exploited numerous tmes over the past two seasons at Arizona … Against stronger and more physical defenders he was often bullied in the paint and struggled to finish through contact … At times last season the game appeared to move too quickly for Comanche on both ends of the floor, which says that his feel for the game is not there yet … This is likely one of the main reasons he saw such limited playing time in both years … Besides his length and athleticism, he doesn’t have a go to skill yet offensively, as he is limited to mostly put backs, backdoor cuts, and drop off passes … He shot 57% from the field last season, but most of those opportunities were uncontested finishes … His lack of strength was more of a factor in his inability to finish around the rim in traffic when he didn’t have the time or space to load up … He also does not have elite hands, as he did not show great ability to haul in off target passes or rebound out his area consistently … With Comanche’s combination of physical tools, one would think he would be a pretty good rebounder, but he still has some developing to do in this area … His lack of strength really hinders his ability to box out bigger guys on the interior, and be pushed out of position … While he definitely has great upside as a rebounder, he will have to become much more physical and continue to add strength to ever maximize his athleticism and translate it to better production on the glass.

Rabb is also a big target in the post with his long arms and great hands. He is a bit streaky but definitely capable in the mid-range game, as he utilizes both jab steps and step backs to create separation into his shot. He is crafty in the post with his footwork and is particularly light on his feet when under duress down low … Also has an underrated basketball IQ, and has good feel for recognizing double teams and knowing when to pass out of them … He also has a good understanding of defensive positioning and handled the often-difficult moments at Cal quite maturely … He has good recognition off the ball on defense and does a good job of not fouling when coming over to help from the weak side … His above average ability to close out and defend bigs on the perimeter will help him in today’s NBA … 
","Rabb is more of an old school post player and does not have ideal perimeter skills that NBA teams look for in a modern NBA big man … He does not space the floor with great consistency and shoots a flat ball at times … He will need to become more of a threat off the pick and pop to be a truly reliable offensive weapon in the league, and he must continue to improve as a free throw shooter (66%) … He also does not have the ball skills to create for himself on the perimeter, and most of his scoring will come in the post … He is much better as a straight-line driver, but when the defense takes this away, he is not fluid or skilled enough to utilize a counter move and create offense for himself effectively … He also struggles to attack closeouts off the pick and pop, which really limits him offensively … Lacks the strength to finish against NBA caliber big men with better length and athleticism … His skillset projects towards him being more of a center in the NBA, but he may not have the size and strength to be effective there … He can be knocked out of position pretty easily and does not have good body control against contact … This sort of tweener identity limits his defensive potential as well, as he is a tad small for the five and not quite rangy enough for the four … He is limited as a rim protector with only 1.3 blocks per 40 minutes, and could be a liability in the pick and roll when needed to switch out against smaller players …

","Besides his baby hook, doesn’t have an array of post moves in his repertoire … Has mostly relied on being taller and more athletic than most of his competition … Must get stronger and fill out his frame as much as possible … Can easily be knocked off his spot in the paint … Besides rim protection he’s not really a great overall defender … Not quick laterally and often doesn’t seem to be moving fluidly when defending on the ball … Strictly a post player at this point, Rabb hasn’t adapted to the new ""position less basketball"" movement … If he’s not able to score in the post he will drift out to the perimeter, which isn’t the strongest part of his game at the moment … Really left-hand dominant, needs to put more work in on his off hand … Needs to continue to improve at the free throw line as well … 
Overall: Rabb has steadily improved over his entire high school career and there’s no reason to think he has reached his full potential yet … Will be heavily featured along with Top 5 Overall Recruit, Jaylen Brown, next year for the Cal Bears … Hopefully a college lifting program will see him pack on the muscle and strength that have been missing … If Rabb ever completely puts it together on the court, the sky is the limit in terms of what kind of player he can be in the NBA.

Committed only 165 turnovers in 140 NCAA games while dishing 768 Assists. ",5/2/17,"The undisputed king of collegiate assist to turnover ratio enters the 2017 draft as an extremely experienced and high level floor general … Monte Morris’ ability to play big time minutes, and not turn the ball over is an obvious value at any level … His senior season in Ames he sported a 5.16 A/To ratio, his best at ISU … Morris’ offensive IQ is extremely high, and his ball handling, while not overtly flashy, is also well above average … He’s adept at using screens, penetrating the lane, and executing a fast break to perfection, which are translatable at any level … Monte is also a very good shooter … He’s never shot below .358% on 3s in college, and as a senior, he nailed .378% on 4.1 attempts per contest … He’s also a very good free throw shooter, and has a very good intuition in regards to shot selection … Morris can pull up off the dribble in the mid-range as well, and this again is utilized effectively due to his knowledge of spacing … Athletically, he’s quick and has good end to end speed with or without the ball in his hands … While lean, Morris stands 6’3’’ in shoes, and measures a solid 6’5’’ wingspan … He definitely possesses adequate size to guard the majority of NBA point guards … Monte’s defensive skills include quick hands, and good instinct in the passing lanes … Finishing at the rim was not a problem for him either at the college level … His 65% clip at the rim (according to hoop-math.com) is extremely good for a point guard … Plus, he has some room to fill out in terms of muscle mass … He used this length rather nicely on the glass where he pulled down 4.8 boards per contest, which is good for a point guard … 
","One pretty obvious weakness for Morris will be his slight 175 pound frame … For him to maximize his NBA potential he’ll need to fill out in order to compete with physical, strong NBA backcourts … He’s also a solid athlete, but at the next level, he’s going to give up athleticism on a nightly basis … He has the IQ to mitigate some of this, but it’s still a deficit … I feel Morris’ main issue in the NBA will be improving his scoring, and/or finding a niche in the NBA … It’s a luxury that he can be so efficient running an offense, but does not screwing up really warrant NBA minutes? Further honing his 3 point shot to become a 40+% shooter would also help his cause, this is very do-able because of his good mechanics … Since he most likely won’t be hanging his hat on the defensive end, he’ll need to up his game … He’ll turn 23 before his first NBA game, so he’ll need to figure out his NBA niche fairly quick or risk teams giving that roster spot to a guy they feel has a higher ceiling … 
Overall: Monte Morris is a coachable player, with an extremely high level basketball IQ. A point guard to the truest sense, those skills translate, point blank. His biggest hurdle, aside from adding bulk, will be improving his scoring, and finding the right system. Basketball IQ goes a long way, and while not a high level prospect, Fred Van Vleet and Ron Baker come to mind as guards from last year’s draft who were rock solid, overlooked, and ended up on NBA rosters. Whether Morris is drafted or not, I feel he has a legit shot to stick in the league.

","Not a great outside shooter.  Only made 29% from distance last season.  Needs to polish his mechanics and hit on a more consistent basis.  Struggles mightily on jumpers when guarded.  Release slowed by bringing the ball down to his knees before rising up and releasing.  Simply needs to be more consistent with his shot mechanics…Opponents will find it easier to stay in front of Smart because they don’t have to guard him as tight and respect his jumper…Not a very efficient scorer.  Needs to take smarter jump shots and not settle for pull-up threes…Could stand to be more patient and unselfish rather than forcing it and becoming dead-set on taking a shot at times…His assist/turnover ratio of 1.78 is not great.  Could certainly cut down on turnovers and be more patient on offense.  His aggression can sometimes be a weakness.  It also leads to offensive fouls on occasion…Mediocre ballhandler, another source of his turnover problems…Uses his physical gifts well, but ultimately doesn’t have great athleticism…Free throw percentage dropped from 78% to 73% between his freshman and sophomore seasons…Interestingly enough, Smart’s knack for making winning plays did not generally carry over to crunch time.  In 7 Cowboys games that Smart played in this season that were decided by 3 or fewer points or in overtime, Smart shot a mere 3/14 (21%) from the field in the final two minutes and overtime of those games.  He also missed several free throws in that span…Can be a bit of a ""flopper""…Smart’s teams have lost in their first game in the NCAA Tournament in each of the past two years, despite being expected to win both times.  The Cowboys also went on a big-time skid to end the Big 12 regular season, due, in part, to Smart’s suspension and inability to right the ship as the team point guard and star player…NBA scouts will have the Texas Tech incident fresh in their minds, when Smart lost his cool and shoved a fan, earning him a three-game suspension.  Smart doesn’t always maintain his composure, which can force him to make bad decisions both in and out of gameplay, and doesn’t always have a grey attitude or body language on the court.  This incident could have scared away a few teams at the top of the draft…

He also has good closing speed on the perimeter and can chase guards off the perimeter due to his fluidity … He also has good lateral quickness and can switch/hedge out on ball screens and still recover … He also offers upside as a rim protector with his length and solid timing once he can refine his defensive awareness … He can also use his length to get in passing lanes and force turnovers off the ball. 
","Wilson has some outstanding physical tools, but he still needs to learn how to maximize them with consistency … Often times instead of getting all the way to the rim and finishing with his length, he will settle for contested jumpers even when switched on a smaller player … He has a tendency to float on the perimeter when matched up with smaller players instead of posting up and using his size … He has great skill, but he will settle for a lot of contested jumpers early on in the shot clock … Wilson does not have great vision and can improve as a passer out of the post … He has a good handle for his size but will try to do too much at times and over dribble instead of relying on primary ball handlers, which leads to avoidable turnovers … Wilson needs to improve his physicality and toughness in the post, as he does not work hard to get good position against players his size … He also is not a great finisher in traffic and does not get to the free throw line that often (2.3 FTA per 40). He is skilled but he shies away from contact and mostly relies on finesse rather than physicality. He has great upside on the defensive end, but he needs to improve his awareness before he reaches that level … He can be late to hedge out on ball screens and often gets beat off the ball on cuts … He can do a better job of staying low and being in a good stance to maximize his explosiveness … He also does not always see the ball well, which makes him late to come over to the ball side and help out when needed, and he does not always jump to the ball from the weak side … The biggest thing he could improve upon, however, is his production on the glass … In 30 minutes of action last season, he averaged only 5.3 rebounds per game … With his combination of size, length, and athleticism, that number should be much higher … Improving his toughness and learning how to get good position down low will allow him to be much more of a factor here …

","Has a below average wingspan (6-9) for his size … Needs to continue bulking up, but be careful not to lose his flexibility and mobility … His competitive nature can get the better of him sometimes and make him lose concentration for a few plays … He can lose focus from time to time and look a little lethargic on the floor … Doesn’t have an elite burst which limits him in isolation situations … He has problems blowing by athletic opponents from a standstill, which makes him settle for mid-range shots … His below 70% free throw shooting is alarming for a wing … Needs work in Spot Up and Catch and Shoot situations… He is a streaky shooter for now, he could go hot or cold at any time  … Has problems creating separation against long, athletic opponents for now … He has the tendency to change mechanics when opponents are closing out on him on the perimeter  … Extremely right hand dominant when driving to the basket, which can make him predictable … Left hand needs a lot of work… His lack of elite athletic tools hurts him when he has to finish at the rim against length … Has problems finishing through contact and at times even looks like he is trying to avoid contact altogether … He occasionally gets stuck with the ball in his hands, dribbling, becoming kind of a ball stopper … If he wants to be a good creator at an NBA level he must improve at changing speeds and direction … It would be beneficial for him to add some counters to his post up game … Decision making still needs some work, as he can try to do things too fast or too slow at times, which leads to turnovers  … His passes can be a little off sometimes … Assist/turnover ratio should improve … His energy on defense can be inconsistent … Gets caught up behind screens when he is chasing a shooter … He might be a step too slow when he is guarding a good athlete on the perimeter, which could be problematic … Has problems reading screens on the defensive end in Pick and Roll situations …
Outlook: Deni Avdija is generally considered the best player of his generation in Europe … He has been amazing at FIBA’s Youth championships for years … On paper he is the definition of a new era wing, since he could be a two way force with great offensive skill set and above average defensive potential … His ability to create for himself and his teammates is that makes him so unique … If he ends up in the right environment he has a shot to develop into something special …

In space he can also finish above the rim with authority even when challenged at the basket, and he is good vertical athlete (37.5” max vertical) … His strength helps him out on defense as well; even though he lacks length, he uses his strength and physicality to compete for good position and contain the dribble … Brooks also has a versatile offensive skillset that Pac-12 teams had an extremely difficult time figuring out … He averaged 25.1 points per 40 minutes, which was good for second in the conference, and he is excellent isolation player … He can score from all three levels, via at the rim, in the mid range area, and from beyond the arc (40.4% on 4.1 attempts per game) … He is also a much improved playmaker, doing an especially solid job in drive and kick situations … Brooks is not just a ball dominant scorer though … He has shown the ability to play off the ball and space the floor due to his improved catch and shoot play and ability to spot up in transition … He does an excellent job of getting his feet set quickly and squaring his shoulders to the basket on his jumper … When chased off the line, he has an outstanding pull-up game … Brooks proved over the last two years that he was one of the best tough shot makers in college basketball … He has deep range and can bury contested shots off the dribble … He also is great at creating space via jab steps and step back jumpers. His ambidexterity around the basket also makes him a lot more dangerous as a scorer around the rim and really completes his offensive repertoire … Brooks also shows flashes of terrific vision (4.3 assists per 40 minutes) whether kicking out to open shooter or to big men ducking in the low post … In addition, it is difficult to ignore the advanced mental aspects of Brooks’ game … He never seems to lose confidence and clearly is not afraid of the big moment … Brooks hit multiple game-winning shots this year and was a key piece in Oregon’s Final Four run that included an upset-win over top-seeded Kansas in the Elite Eight … 
","The biggest question at this stage with Brooks is how much his less than stellar length (6-6 wingspan) will hold him back in the NBA … Even though he has the strength to finish through contact, his lack of length impedes his ability to finish over defenders with NBA-level physical profiles … It is also uncertain whom he will be able to guard at the next level with his lack of elite length or quickness, which causes him to struggle containing quicker guards off the dribble … He was most effective guarding fours in college, but they will be much bigger and longer in the NBA … He may not be able to create offense effectively against NBA wings either, as he benefited in college from playing a lot of small-ball four … A good portion of his offense came via straight line drives, but he will not be able replicate this in the pros, and he does not have much shiftiness with the ball as a counter … When his straight line drive is taken away he does not have much change of direction skill … He does not change speed with the ball well and is really not the most advanced ball handler either … He also lacks burst from a stand still position, preventing him from turning the corner at times … He probably will not be able to rely on isolation scoring in the NBA, but much of his offense came from these types of plays … How will he fit into an NBA offense without disrupting its flow? Brooks also averaged 3.3 turnovers per 40 minutes, which is a higher number than what one would like to see from a forward … He also is not an effective rebounder at just 5.1 rebounds per 40 minutes, showing some inconsistent effort on box outs and fighting for good position … Brooks will need to show that he can bring more to the table than shot making if he wants to be a reliable rotational player in the NBA …

For the first time in his collegiate career, Milton also proved he could be a primary scorer and averaged 18 ppg last season while not letting his efficiency drop too much … Shake shot 45% from the field, and even went for 33 points in a win over Wichita State … A pretty solid rebounder, he pulled down 4.7 per contest, and has the size to hit the glass in the NBA as well … While not the quickest or most explosive player, Milton’s great wingspan and size should make him at least an average defender when looking to the next level … He averaged 1.4 steals and .6 blocks last season, both solid numbers for a guard.
","Shake lacks top end speed and athleticism many elite guard prospects possess … During the combine, he only sported a 33” max vertical, and his speed and agility drills were middle of the pack at best … These limits may have played a part in his 48.3% FG percentage at the rim last season (hoop-math.com) which is a very poor number for a guard who possesses such great length and size … Finishing at the rim in the NBA is only going to get harder … You’d also like Shake’s assist to TO ratio to be a little higher … While 2.3 TO’s per game isn’t a high number, he only created 4.5 shots per game, which leaves him with a sub 2.0 A/TO ratio … This asserts he’s more of a combo guard than an NBA one … In today’s position-less prone league this is less of an issue, but he certainly has more value as a big point guard, than he does as a shooting guard with some handle … From a shooting standpoint, Milton’s numbers are great, but he release is a little low, and in front of his face … This may give him issues getting shots off against larger, more athletic defenders … Ended his junior season by breaking a bone in his hand …
Overall:  Shake Milton is a big bodied combo guard with a massive wingspan and a nice jumper. He’s improved every season at SMU and showcased the ability to play two NBA positions. While he doesn’t have plus athleticism, he’s great in transition, and has shown the ability to work well in pick and roll situations. Shake is an intriguing option for a team looking to add depth at the guard spot in the second round, and at 21 he still has some upside as a player to develop.

He possesses a knack for rebounding the ball despite not always being in the best position. Cheick’s per 40 minute rebound numbers would come right in at 13.3 per game. His long arms, really aid in his ability to grab misses on the defensive end. He also showed the ability to finish strong around the hoop, and good hands catching alley oops. It should also be noted that despite a season in which he probably tallied a lot fewer minutes than he expected, Cheick was an engaged player off the bench, and showed positive body language and overall team support when his minutes began to fade during Big 12 play.
","Cheick’s decision making offensively is really far away from being much of an asset at the NBA level. His usage percentage was 21.7% was 2nd only on the team to Perry Ellis’ 25.5% and Diallo only dished out 1 assist on the season to pair with 17 turnovers. Despite sporting a good overall FG% (54.7%) his shot selection showed he had little grasp of the flow of the game, and good ball movement. He was also prone to lazy passes due to lack of adjustment to the offensive speed of college basketball. He can hit a 15 footer at a decent clip, which is a positive sign for his shot development, but he’s got a bit of a hitch in his shot movement that would benefit him if he corrected. Diallo must also continue to hit the weights, he’s not ready for a major NBA role next season, but has a nice frame to add muscle. An extra 15 pounds and some physical maturity would do him wonders.
Overall: Cheick Diallo is an upside pick at this point in his development. With the ball in his hands, he’s very far away from being a factor outside of dunking and playing very close to the rim right now. It’d be best if Diallo can learn to stick to simplicity until he can further hone his game on that end. On the other hand, defensively and collecting misses he shows considerable potential. His calling card at the next level will probably by weak side shot blocking, defensive rebounding, and hustle. There’s still plenty to like despite an underwhelming freshman season at Kansas, and all in all Cheick handled it with maturity many teenagers wouldn’t.

Is described as a gym rat, constantly looking to add to his game and made definite strides from senior year of HS to his freshman year of college … Though he is not an elite leaper, his length makes him a shot blocking and shot changing force …
","The same youth and inexperience that makes him so intriguing might also mean a rougher transition to the pro game … Seems to lack a great feel and often appears to be ""thinking"" instead of just reacting and playing instinctively … Confidence is still an issue. Despite possessing great offensive tools, he took relatively few shots for a team banking on him to be a 2nd scoring option … Relies more on length than athletic ability, could also be questions about whether adding additional weight slows him down even more than it has seemed to since growing into the 4 spot … Needs work on his low post footwork, still adjusting to life as a PF as opposed to playing on the wing … On court awareness on both ends is still a work in progress, sometimes he lacks a bit of focus which could be attributed to lack of confidence and inexperience … Got into foul trouble fairly often, needs to play defense more with his feet than his arms … While his offensive skill set is tantalizing, some question whether he will develop the killer mentality that would make him into a viable top scoring option … Though his range projects to be a strength, he still needs work on being a reliable midrange and distance shooter … Turned it over quite a bit, which goes along with developing more court awareness

Averaged 6 steals per game as a senior in high school, at The Village School, in Texas. ",2/5/15,"One of the fastest point guards in the NCAA, Taylor has immense potential in the transition game and his elite change of direction ability and foot speed make him a real threat to get into the lane … He has a deadly floater, an array of one handers, and is a creative finisher. Isaiah is clearly used to getting off high degree of difficulty shots over taller players … He’s a strong ball handler, and right now looks to be able to carry over these skills in the drive and kick game in the NBA. For a young guy (20 years old) he seems to have a nice foundation in the pick and roll game … Texas ran a 3 guard lineup last season, and Taylor put up a very solid 4 apg in a system in which he wasn’t the only guy setting up the offense … He’s tall for a point guard (6’2"" – 6’3’’ in shoes) and he’s a very pesky defender,  especially in man to man situations … He’s been utilized very successfully in press situations, and does a great job of staying in front of his man. This is definitely aided by his direction changing ability and lateral quickness … If he comes away with a steal, he’s down the court with a layup in a split second. He’s also shown improvement on his shot as a sophomore. A good free throw shooter, His 83% clip through his first 12 games in 2014-15 is a solid number, and he’s also shown growth on his long range game already far surpassed his season total for 3 pointers from last season with 8 … His speed gives him intriguing potential and a pretty high ceiling, but he does have to tighten up some other parts of his game and get stronger …
","Although improving, Taylor really lacks a go to jump shot, and it’s very evident as he’s often more comfortable shooting flip shots and one handers 10 feet away from the goal … He hits these shots at a higher rate than one would expect, but it affirms that he isn’t particularly confident in his mid range jumper … He has improved his college three point range, but still lacks the ability to hit the NBA three with any sort of consistency … Isaiah is a thin guy, and only weighs in at 168 lbs. To translate his speed and quickness to the defensive end in the NBA, he’s going to have to bulk up in order to not be constantly giving up a strength advantage … Taylor could probably play at 185-190 pounds while maintaing his quickness. It’d also help him finish at the rim where he shot just 49.2% during the 2013-14 season … Should look to become a more vocal leader … 
Overall: Early in his sophomore season following a broken wrist that put him out of action for 10 games, he’s seen a bit of a dip, but continued growth as a point guard and distributer will most certainly help his NBA stock, as his ability to play under control at a fast pace will make him a tough matchup … Isaiah Taylor has elite speed, and quickness. There may not be a guard in the NCAA who is as fast both with and without the ball in his hands, and he can really do some special things on the break and against defenses that are slow to get back. Taylor has a nice foundation in the drive and kick, and pick and roll games, which plays in well with the way a lot of NBA offenses are ran these days. He needs to continue to hit the weights, and work on his jumper to aid in his jump to the next level. An early season wrist injury halted a very hot start, but he has begun to build upon his early season success.

Vision and playmaking skills seem to be developing nicely … In the Hoop Summit he displayed a reliable handle and the ability to play under control at a high rate of speed, setting up teammates for buckets as well as an emerging pull up jumper. Granted that was against a talented but inexperienced group of high school prospects … A solid defender, showing a good understanding of spacing and staying in defensive position with his hands active without reaching. Displays a lot of potential to be an on ball pest with his quick feet and huge wingspan … Shows a developing tear drop and would be well served by perfecting it … Also has a deft spin dribble move … Schroeder’s elite level speed is his biggest weapon and gives him a lot of intrigue as an NBA prospect … 
","Still raw, efficiency numbers this season could have been better … His 3.3 to 2.9 a/to ratio display his need to become a more efficient ball protector and distributor. Though it is important to keep in mind that he’s still just 19 … Despite his 40% 3 point shooting numbers, his shot appears to lack the ability to extend out to NBA 3 at this point, as he shoots a bit of a set shot … Just 168 lbs. Frame is slight so getting stronger will be important. At this point he can be easily muscled and knocked off balance by bigger and stronger guards. Narrow shoulders mean he’ll likely never be a physical player … Added strength would allow him to finish after contact and better utilize his ability to get into the paint. It would also benefit him defensively if opponents attempt to post him … Needs to develop the ability to go left. He is too right hand dominant making it easier to defend him by overplaying his right … Much more effective shooting from spot up than off isolation. Gaining the ability to go left would help in this area … Lacks experience playing against a high level of competition, having played this season with a low level German team (New Yorker Phantoms) with lower level Americans and Germans, and the team struggled (13-19) … Will need to develop into a vocal leader as a lead guard … Must become more adept running the pick and roll as a ball handler … Solid athlete but not a dynamic, above the rim type of finisher …

","Comes with obvious size concerns, as a 6’5 225 combo forward whose game isn’t necessarily a safe bet to seamlessly translate … Though a versatile scoring threat in college, he will not likely be able to utilize his back to the basket post game nearly as frequently in the NBA at his size…Has some comfort making open jump shots, but he is not to be confused with a knockdown shooter … His ability to develop his shot and extend his range to the NBA line will be very important for him …Will force shots at times, not always a willing passer …Considering his size, it is imperative for him to be in proper position defensively against bigger players or he will be taking advantage of…Perimeter skills aren’t great right now … Will have to land in the right situation to establish himself in the NBA, but the positionless nature the current game makes his chances better … 2 injuries to the same foot that derailed his senior season are cause for concern, teams will have their eye on that

While his form and touch suggest he could develop a 3 point shot, to this point he has not been able to add that element to his game … His passing at times can be sloppy, though his 2 assists per game are solid for a big and show that he’s not a black hole on offense … Perhaps just slightly undersized at the center position at 6’10 … Will be 21 (August 15th) before the 2019 NBA Season begins, so his upside is not as intriguing as a true freshman … Not the most formidable shot blocker or rim protector, though he’s solid in this area with a chance to improve. He’ll need to focus more attention to this area of the game … 
Outlook: Has a very bright future with the amount of improvement he’s shown over his two years at Maryland … At times his play evokes memories of Hakeem Olajuwon with his spin moves and baby hooks. He’s still got a long ways to go in terms of offensive polish, and doesn’t have nearly the same dynamic explosiveness and athleticism … But his patience and clever ability to create baskets give his game shades of Hakeem … If he can continue to expand his offensive game and extend his range and shot blocking ability, he can develop into one of the top centers of his generation at the next level … he figures to be the top center available in this year’s draft …

Likely to be bullied by power guards and wings … It’s difficult to define how his skill sets translate to the next level, as Barton is a unique player without a clear-cut role … He’s also a year old for his grade, born January 1991, so that must be taken into account when guaging his potential …

In Europe expect Mirotic to become and remain a very important player for any of the top teams for many years to come. Without any doubt he has absolute Euroleague star player potential. However for his development and to get the maximum out of his basketball career, the situation where he ends up might be crucial to making it or not across the Atlantic.",5/28/11,"A 6’10” forward with potential. Actually the potential has already become a reality this season with Real Madrid, one of the traditional powerhouses and present at the recently played Euroleague Final Four. A good frame  … Yet he shows good balance, mobility and also a very nice wingspan … He’s got pretty good hands and a soft shooting touch, offering good reliability from beyond the arch up to the foul line. Shot selection is really excellent … He’s also willing to take the big shots to help win games … Might not be the quickest shooter, but his release and rhythm are good and he can create shots off the dribble when necessary. Able to score from the outside, able to penetrate and also a skilled low post player with a variety of moves … He handles the ball well with both hands for a guy of his size, and often helps to dribble the ball up court when the guard is being overplayed. Offensively Mirotic is tremendously versatile. Even if he’s missing better strength and athleticism, a good first step and very controlled drives gets him to draw many fouls. Adding to that a very high basketball IQ, good court awareness and anticipation, which allows him to make very quick decisions once he receives the ball. Spin moves (including over baseline foot), left and right up and unders and jump hooks, turn around jumpers, 45 degrees bank shots and shotfakes all form in a natural part of his repertoire. And he’s a reliable finisher inside. Apart from scoring himself, he contributes in the functioning of his team by making the ball move around on the perimeter. He also knows how to post up, seal off his position and maintain it. Being a good passer with an even better court vision enables him to find his teammates from the low post or out of dribble when driving towards the basket. In offensive rebounding he continuously tries to find a good position, often succeeding follow ups or at least getting touches to obtain a new possession. Defending pick and roll isn’t an issue either, considering his physical assets to hedge and recuperate as required. At this point defensively he can be matched up with both small and power forwards. Not a great shotblocker in the way of a top leaper who goes for each shot, nonetheless he manages to block a fair share of them due to very good help side positioning, timing and awareness. 
","Even though agility and leaping are just average, surprisingly he’s quite quick off his feet and is able to run the floor well when he puts his mind to it … Over the years, there have been moments where a lack of motivation and concentration affected his running effort and activity on offense … Overall I would catalogue his athleticism as just okay for NBA standards … Has a good frame but will need to add additional strength … He is a better set shooter than creating shots for himself … He’s much more effective in half court offenses than in one on one fastbreak situations. When he’s on the receiving end in pick and roll plays, he mostly steps out the 3 point line and continues just occasionally inside. Even though he usually does box out and picks up defensive rebounds, rebounding is an aspect that he can still improve significantly. Whereas he can successfully defend speed (in Europe), against power it’s a lot more complicated. He’s unable to stop somebody who takes him one on one to the basket, as his body lacks the strength to contain many players …

","Will need to add upper body strength if he hopes to find the same success rebounding at the next level … A vast majority of his offense comes from offensive rebounds, so he will need to refine his skills and find other ways to score consistently … Has a slow, methodical release, and thus players can quickly close out on him leading to inconsistency shooting the ball … Not incredibly quick laterally, has a hard time guarding perimeter players once they commit to the dribble … Has been good around the rim, though still not as efficient as one might hope, which again points to lack of strength … For a player who moves as well as he does for his size, has not been overly efficient in transition … Rarely goes to his off-hand, needs a lot of work on his left … Foul trouble has been an issue, partly from playing out of position, though focus on defense has also been an issue … The “tweener” label may apply to him, needs to refine his skills and show more consistency as an overall perimeter player, while at the same time needing to gain strength while hopefully developing more of a traditional post game if he wants to excel as a PF

He also does a good job of absorbing contact at the rim and getting to the free throw line, where he does a nice job of converting (77.5% this season) … One of the most appealing aspects of Simmons’ game is that he is a gifted athlete … In his senior year of high school, his vertical leap was measured to be at 42”, and that could increase further as his frame fills out in the next couple of years … His combination of size and elite quickness and athleticism give him intriguing upside as a defensive player … Simmons is already a good on-ball defender, but he has the potential to be a lockdown defensive stopper at the next level if he applies himself and gets stronger, with his ability to guard multiple positions … He also has great instincts as an off-the-ball defender, leading Arizona with nine charges taken this season … There is a lot of upside for Simmons, and he could potentially become an excellent NBA player. 
","As good as Simmons is with the ball in his hands at creating offense, he isn’t enough of a facilitator … He does not look to pass very often when he gets into the lane, as he is constantly looking for his own shots when he’s on the floor … He is much more of an isolation player at this stage, and he struggles to operate out of the pick-and-roll as a playmaker, which is a vital tool for success in the NBA as a lead guard … Simmons played 23.5 minutes per game at Arizona this past season, but he only averaged two assists per contest, a sign that his playmaking instincts need to improve …  He did not turn the ball over that frequently, coughing it up 1.2 times per game, but he has a tendency to over dribble and play out of control, which leads to bad turnovers … Maturity and attitude are points that scouts note that he must improve upon … His attitude came under fire after Trier returned to the team at midseason and he was visibly unhappy with coming off the bench. His play suffered as he stopped moving the ball as willingly, and Coach Miller was forced to cut his minutes futher … If he wants to make it as a point guard in the association, it is imperative that he improves his decision-making and starts getting his teammates more involved … Inefficiency is also a concern for Simmons right now … He shot just 39.5% from the field in his freshman season, which is largely the result of subpar shot selection … As good as he is off the dribble, he needs to improve his consistency as a spot-up shooter, as he made only 32% of his threes this season … In the NBA, it is so difficult to be a consistent scorer without a reliable jump shot, so this needs to be a priority … Maybe the biggest concern for now is adding strength to his slender frame. He weighs less than 200 pounds, which will be a problem at the next level when matched up with bigger guards in the NBA … However, he is still just 19 years old, so he should develop physically with time … A kid with a very high ""situational dependency"" at the next level for him to reach his potential … Could have used an additional season in college to improve his skill level, however he apparently was always of the mindset that he was a one and done player …

His junior season at Kentucky he shot 72.5% at the rim, and he’s an active player on the offensive glass which helped him rack up 40 put backs in 38 games … He had a number of highlight plays in which he went over and through defenders for highlight finishes at the rim … Although not a major offensive threat, he has improved his free throw shooting every season starting from an anemic .372% as a freshman, to a significantly better .617% as a junior (granted 61% remains below average) … This work has also shown up in his ability to knock down short jump shots in the half court game … He also has a decent jump hook which could potentially be honed over time … Cauley-Stein is also very productive in his time on the court … Due to UK’s depth he played just 25.8 minutes per game, but his per 40 minute averages are 14.1 ppg 10 rpg 2.6 bpg and 1.8 spg … 
","Willie is very much a defensive oriented player, and a guy who really doesn’t project into much of an offensive contributor  … His work at the free throw line has shown some promise, but he projects mostly as a lob finisher, roll target, and garbage man in an NBA offense … His touch and shooting are a real weakness in terms of game speed … He’s also had some ups and downs over his career in terms of focus … For a player with such immense phyical gifts, it’s baffling that he wasn’t a more productive player early in his college career … Feel for the game is a major question mark … WCS has exhibited more poise, and fire as a junior, but he still has shown times in which he’s seemed a little passive or not 100% into the game … WCS has the feel of an athlete who is becoming a basketball player, and while the intrigue with his defensive abilities is apparent, he remains a project for the NBA level … Continued improvement and growth in terms of focus will be needed in order to play a long 82 game NBA season …  
Overall: Willie Cauley-Stein is a player you can plug in your system in order to play high level defense, and provide both versatility guarding perimeter players and the ability to guard the rim … His one side of the ball type of play will cause him to be drafted below players that have two way potential, but he has the ability to be very good, or possibly elite as a defender if he can harness his improved metal focus, and grow as a professional …

","There are some obvious things to point out with Mika that hurt him … For one, he is already 22 years old as a sophomore … His best option would be to come out now because if he goes to school anymore, his age will make it difficult for teams to get excited about him … There is absolutely nothing wrong with what Mika did, selflessly going on a Mormon mission to Italy, but it made carving out an NBA career more of a challenge … Those two years could have been crucial in developing his body and playing style … He did play in a relatively weak conference for two seasons, granted the West Coast conference has talent, even featuring a National Runner-Up Gonzaga … Not facing off against more consistent, higher level talent may hurt his stock, as will his lack of post season experience/success …
Overall: Eric Mika has the body, physique, traits and skills that will give him a shot to make it in the league … His ability to score in multiple ways makes him a hybrid big man that is now dominating the NBA … Unfortunately for him, his age is a big factor just like any 22-year-old senior would have to deal with and there is nothing he can do about that (but he’s not a senior) … The last BYU player selected in the NBA draft was Jimmer Fredette and though Mika is considered a long shot to be drafted this year, he did receeive an invite to the NBA Draft combine … He can definitely make is as an undrafted player and play some summer league games or impress in the D-League (or G-League?) … Mika is a great person who cares a lot about people, but also cares about his team and being a consummate leader to his teammates …

Outlook: Schofield climbed NBA Draft boards after a stellar senior season … The kid can shoot it, has range is explosive getting to the rim, and has the physique to keep pace in the NBA right now … He also seems to be a great kid on top of being a very talented basketball player … Schofield seems to be hovering around the beginning of the second round (Where Crowder was drafted), but with great workouts he could catapult into a fringe first-rounder …

Talented and tough he was the star player of the highly valued freshman class of Kentucky … He has been very solid averaging 15 points and over 10 rebounds per game, but the poor performance of the Wildcats until the NCAA tournament seemed to have diminished the Randle brand … His upside is in fact the same one he had one year ago, very limited. However he is definitely a player ready to produce … You always know what you are going to get from him, and March Madness has proved he can help his team succeed …",4/3/14,"Very strong upper body and a reliable left hand … He shows a strong motor, and finishes well around the rim with contact … He is very skilled with his face up game and has shown some creative finishing ability … He is very dangerous on P&R and Pick and Pop, because of his ability to hit mid-range jumpers … Though he lacks elite explosiveness, he is able to use his strong frame to protect the ball and avoid blocks … On the offensive boards he is an absolute beast, relentless in seeking out rebounds … The same thing is true on the defensive end where he has natural instincts for rebounds … A pretty good post defender, he uses his strong body to not allow taller opponents to get close to the rim … He doesn’t have the quickest feet in the world, but definitely really good for a big, very balanced … Potentially he can switch on P&R situations for a couple of dribbles, but needs to improve on his showing … Randle is a mix of power, skills and balance that makes him a very interesting prospect … Despite being just a freshman he could have an immediate impact in the NBA due to his strength and offensive skills … He has drawn positive reviews for his attitude and coach-ability and appears to be a hard working kid that leaves everything on the floor every game and every practice …
","Despite all the good things mentioned about his game there are a lot of concerns about Randle … In a way Randle’s high energy, ""bully ball"" style of playing reminds some of how Shabazz, at a different position, overpowered people last year and we’ve seen how much the former UCLA small forward has struggled in the league … It’s been noted that Randle is undersized for the PF position, lacking ideal length with a sub 7 foot wingspan … He may struggle to create looks against stronger, more athletic and taller opponents in the post … Offensively his numbers on synergy indicate how difficult it has been for him to score on post moves with very low percentages on each low post block and over either shoulder … It also doesn’t help matters that he is not able to utilize his right hand … Very few, even highly talented, players are able to play at high level without being able to finish and make moves with both hands, as the book becomes well known and everyone overplays their strength. I’m not sure if Randle fits this category, but the fear is there … His shooting isn’t consistent and despite good mechanics, his percentages are low and 3pts range is non-existent … He will have to develop a consistent solid jumpshot to replicate the success of Zach Randolph and Michael Beasley when facing the basket … Overall his game right now is based almost entirely on overpowering weaker opponents … He is very skilled but it will be hard to find the same success overpowering post players in the league. Also it is worth considering that most of Randle’s game is below the rim … His future will likely hinge more heavily than most prospects on landing in the right system, where a team has a vision of how to utilize him and makes sure he stays focused and works hard on the right skill development … A bad team or loss or focus could pose a huge risk to his NBA career …

","Good, but not great athlete … Fundamentally sound player at this stage but lacks explosiveness …  Still doesn’t have great post moves and needs to work on his footwork around the basket … He projects as a PF at the next level but will need to develop more of a post game and not rely so much on his jump shot … While he’s a great defender in space and out on the perimeter for a big man, he isn’t the greatest post defender and isn’t really a shot blocker … His ceiling isn’t as high as some of the other big man prospects at this point due to his lack of elite athleticism and lack of great footwork in the paint … Still a raw player on both sides of the floor but is developing …
Overall: Portis has the prototypical size for a PF at the next level and has really improved from his freshman to sophomore season … He’s continued to improve upon his range which is a positive but really needs to develop a better back to the basket game and at least one go-to move in the post before he will be a truly effective player at the next level … The good news is that he has an NBA ready body and can concentrate on the technical parts of his game instead of adding weight and muscle … Will need to continue to be a guy that gives maximum effort from night to night to make up for his deficiencies …

","Ojeleye is a bit undersized for a power forward even in today’s small ball heavy NBA at 6’7”, and he doesn’t have elite length either at 6’10” (wingspan) … Defensive fit will be a big question mark going forward as he’s not quite big enough to match up with traditional fours, and he doesn’t have a ton of experience guarding NBA-level wings, as a result of playing in the AAC … His instincts on that end have room to improve as well, evident by his low block and steal rates … Ojeleye can also be more productive on the defensive glass (just 5.5 d-boards per 40 minutes) … If he is going to play the four for long stretches in the NBA, he will need to add some improvement here … Ojeleye’s lack of elite size and average standstill leaping will hurt him as an interior scorer in the NBA, and his overall perimeter skill set could use some polish if he wants to play more minutes on the perimeter … Ojeleye is not nearly as explosive in traffic, and he is not a great ball handler for a wing player … He also does not have a great left hand, which can make it difficult to succeed in the NBA without some degree of ambidexterity … Another big question mark will be how he adjusts from the poor level of competition of the American conference this season to the NBA … He did little to squander these questions when SMU had big NCAA tournament expectations, but were bounced early by USC, a team with great size, length, and athleticism …

Played FR and So years at UTEP.,1/16/12,"High-level athlete combo forward with excellent size and length. Versatile offensive skill set to score inside/outside (16.5 PPG). Could be seen as being big enough to play center in today’s NBA. He possesses rare agility at 6’11 in tandem with a hunger for activity and relentless motor. Runs the court like a guard, with a fluid gait and long, easy strides.  Nightmare matchup for opponents on the interior due to explosive quickness and elevation. Extraordinarily nimble and quick mover in the paint. He has added strength and bulk (225 to 240) without losing that calling card explosiveness. Uses his athleticism to earn high percentage looks (58%), elevating above defenders. Displays a deft touch and equally adept at finishing with his left hand. Electric spin moves in the post over either shoulder, preferring to attack baseline. Body control and hang time to make the appropriate in-air adjustments and alter release after a bump or if impeded. 83% free throw shooter on over 5 attempts (65% as sophomore). Rebounds at will on both the offensive and defensive backboards, ranking amongst the nation’s leaders with 10.8 per game. Quick leaper on multiple jumps while still retaining 1st jump lift. Utilizes his length and mobility to rebound out his direct vicinity. Flourished on the perimeter during his time at UTEP, albeit in a more liberal style of play. Comfortable in the mid-range with the ability to step out behind the three-point stripe. He has the potential to be an effective face-up weapon with a quick first step and long frame. Had a tendency to play in a “rushed state” early in his collegiate career, but has found an efficient pace his junior season. Doesn’t force shots and playing within a more defined role for the betterment of the team. He displays legit lateral quickness and foot speed to defend on the perimeter and not look like a fish out of water. Multiple position defensive adaptability. Mentally and physically a different player since arriving in the SEC.
","Moultrie seems to have transitioned from a SF to PF this season, sacrificing continued perimeter development in the process. Being that he’s not a true post option, he’ll likely see time at both spots on the next level. He’s caught somewhere in between, which can actually be viewed as a strength and serves to illustrate his versatility. Has shown glimpses of range shooting and ball handling aptitude, but more is required for the NBA small forward position.  As he exhibited at UTEP, the potential to be a dynamic face up player is very much present. It’s that potential alone, despite his raw attributes that once again has scouts drooling over his package of skills. Not the most technically sound of prospects, relying on his massive (on most nights) talent, size and athletic advantage. Plays too quickly at times (2.2 TO) and must harness his energy. Could still stand to add more bulk, be more accepting of contact and get to the FT line more consistently. When he begins a move, thinks score only. Not selfish, but at the same time not a prudent passer when attracting defensive attention. At 6’11 with his length and leaping ability, it is inexplicable that he hasn’t been able to block a shot per game (0.9) in any of his three seasons. Basketball IQ and awareness on both ends should sharpen with experience. Moultrie has missed three games in 2011-2012 with tendinitis in both knees.

","Average athlete, not extremely quick, he has poor lateral speed and he’s not explosive … His torn ACL could still present a red flag … His other big flaw is that he’s not a consistent shooter, especially behind the three point line (29% this season in ABA league) and after the pick and roll, he should work on his mechanics and release, which is usually rushed when shooting from the dribble … He lacks a solid midrange game, especially his pull-up jumper, even if he has shown some improvements through the season … His playmaking is really instinctive, he could struggle when forced to play something different than basic set games and simple pick and rolls … On the defensive side he struggles against smaller and quicker opponents due to his poor lateral quickness …

All-ACC 1st Team (2018,2019)",6/13/19,"After hitting big shot after big shot in route to an NCAA Championship at Virginia, Kyle Guy is throwing his hat in the ring in the 2019 NBA draft … An extremely high level long range shooter, Guy averaged .425% from beyond the arc over 3 years at Virginia … His range goes well beyond the NBA mark, and he’s extremely solid in the corners, where this skill has major appeal for spacing concerns … Kyle is crafty running off screens and has good enough ball handling to be able to create some separation when needed … Additionally, he has a quick release with excellent form which will aid him when shooting against longer, more athletic defenders … He also converted at the free throw line at an impressive 83% clip last season, and showcased the ability to hit big shots under lots of pressure throughout the Cavaliers tourney run … A surprisingly effective finisher around the rim, Guy is pretty quick and has the ability to improvise and hit a variety of flip shots and layups around the hoop … Hit 66.7% of his shots at the rim (hoop-math.com), which is very good for a player listed at 6’2 … Not a point guard, but has good vision, and is capable of making the right pass. In addition, he’s an extremely low mistake player who only turned the ball over 116 times in 3081 minutes during three seasons at Virginia (1 TO per 26 minutes of play) … Full of a vast array of tricks and hesitation moves in order to draw contact on his shots … An above average athlete, Kyle tested a 36.5 vertical, a 3.06 shuttle run and a 3.28 second 3/4 court sprint … He also displays plenty of in game quickness, and extremely quick hands on the defensive end. While undersized from an NBA capacity, playing in such a team defensive system in college helped display a good defensive IQ that will help make up for his slight frame and lack of height … A 6’4.5; wingspan is also a decent measurement for a player barely over 6 feet tall … A plus rebounder for a player with his physical makeup, his 4.8 rpg mark in ACC play was actually up from his non-conference number …
","The biggest and most obvious knock on Kyle Guy is just a sheer lack of both height, and muscle … At just 168.7 pounds at the combine, he was the lightest player, and would be one of the lightest players in the NBA … He’ll need to gain strength to be able to fight off, and defend NBA guards … Additionally, at 6’0.75 barefoot and 6’2.25 in shoes, he’s very undersized for an NBA shooting guard … This will hinder his effectiveness on both ends of the floor … Even in an era where combo guards are more and more apparent, Guy will need to take his ball handling from above average to good or better in order to find regular minutes on an NBA court … Despite a solid wingspan his 7’11.5 standing reach will make him very easy to shoot over for opposing players … Playing next to Ty Jerome, he didn’t need to act as a facilitator much for the Cavaliers, but improving on his ability to set up others, and acting as more of a facilitator will help his cause at the next level as well … Transitioning to a true combo guard and less of an undersized two has been a good blue print for players similar to him that have made it in the NBA, and Guy would be wise follow suit …
Overall: Kyle Guy is one of the best shooters in the 2019 draft, and a very heady player with an immense bag of tricks to boot. His overall appeal is hindered greatly by his smaller frame, and lack of length, but improvement as a ball handler and initiating some offense could really help his cause. Guy may or may not be drafted, but players with his range and track record of clutch moments don&#39;t come along every day. Singing him to a two way contract and seeing how he develops would be worthwhile if he doesn’t bolt overseas. He could very well find himself as a valued reserve with a year or two of development in professional basketball under his belt.

","Tweener. What was versatility in college translates to lack of a true position in the NBA … Defense is extremely suspect. Lacks flexibility. Stiff body and ankles. Lacks lateral speed … Finding a place for him on defense will be difficult as his lack of quickness and foot speed will make it tough for him to stay in front of NBA SF’s, and his lack of size will make it difficult to guard NBA PF’s … Lack of foot speed will also affect his offensive effectiveness off the dribble … His rebounding rate was somewhat lacking in college, especially compared to other college PF’s … Much of his offense inside the 3pt. line is predicated on overpowering the weaker defenders he was matched up with in college, which will limit his productivity in the NBA … Doesn’t have the quickness to get past most NBA defenders … Underwhelming athleticism … Though his big frame can be advantageous, it can also limit him in some ways…

","Hamilton is an incredibly inefficient offensive player.  He shot a mere 42% inside the arc last season and his FG percentage was an abysmal 39% … His shot selection is often questionable in the half court … Lacks the blow by speed or the craftiness to get by his man or all they way to the rim with any consistency …  He often drives into a brick wall and has to throw up a tough shot … Despite his decent length, Hamilton is not  particularly great defender …  His lateral quickness is subpar, his effort appears lax as he’s often standing straight up, and his footwork is often awkward and he has to allow his ballhandler past him … Posted extremely underwhelming numbers at the combine, particularly in the max vertical leap, where his jump was the second-lowest … With his below-average athleticism, he struggles to create his own shot and has to rely on his jumpsuit, which is inconsistent … Extremely skinny.  Packs less than 200 lbs. onto his 6’8"" frame, which will likely cause him to get bullied at the NBA level … Great free throw shooter, but averaged just over 2 attempts per game in college, meaning his opportunities to shine from the line were very limited…
Overall: Hamilton is an intriguing prospect, with tons of upside but also tons of shortcomings.  His potential based off his size-vision combination may very well get him drafted, but his inconsistency on both ends of the floor will ensure he does not sniff the first round if he does get selected.

State, but he is capable of creating space, surveying the floor and passing the ball with either hand out of pick and roll situations … With better talent around him in the NBA, he will look like an even better playmaker … His open court speed makes him particularly dangerous in transition, as he will collapse the defense and find cutters or open shooters on the perimeter … He does not need a screen to collapse the defense … Instead he can usually break his man down off the dribble and get in the paint to kick out to open teammates … He also shows flashes of impressive vision and accuracy off the pick and roll … He will have a chance to be an absolute force on both ends of the court in the NBA … Has excellent size at the point guard position at 6’2 with a 6’5 wingspan … Shows a lot of confidence in his abilities and has a swagger on the floor, should not have any trouble adjusting to playing at the NBA level and be a standout PG at the next level … His upside is among the best of any player in this draft …
","Questions about attitude, focus and desire have surrounded Smith since his high school days … Has a tendency to rely on his physical gifts and not pay enough attention to detail in regards to improving as a PG … As talented as Smith is, he is still learning how to play the position and run a team offense at an optimum level … He can improve his feel for when to create his own offense or when to facilitate … He did not always seem to be on the same page with his teammates, which could be interpreted as a lack of leadership … His overall decision-making, particularly off the pick and roll still need to improve, and he needs to become more vocal to be a quality leader in the NBA … He can be a bit turnover prone, as he has a tendency to make careless entry passes and pick up his dribble against pressure without knowing where he wants to go with the ball … He does not always initiate the offense with consistency and can learn to be more unselfish … Often times he will launch a contested shot without any prior passes or turn it over before any set is run … Smith also will settle for long jumpers early in the shot clock or force contested pull up jumpers instead of getting all the way to the rim or making a play for someone else … In transition he is dangerous, but he does not always look ahead for open teammates and will instead force a low percentage shot … He does the same off the pick and roll where he will frequently miss wide open teammates when double teamed off the screen … Smith struggled with consistency this past season in terms of effort and overall impact … Fell asleep defensively far too often showing a lack of commitment and focus … Despite the fact that he has great upside defensively, his intensity has to improve … Smith did not have a great situation at NC State, but a player as talented as him should be able to carry them to a more successful season … Too often he proved to be lazy fighting through screens and closing out on shooters … He can be too upright and often appears uninterested in keeping his man in front of him … As a shooter, he still has room to improve, as he is best with some upward momentum … He releases the ball on the way down sometimes and has an occasional hitch at the top of his release, which leads to sporadic results …

Outlook: After spending three years at Virginia, Marial Shayok decided to transfer to Iowa State to prove that he could be a primary scorer. This worked out well for him as he averaged 18.7 points per game and earned first-team all-Big 12 honors and All-American honorable mention. He has also boosted him draft stock with his senior season and is now considered a late second-round possibility. He does not have much upside, but he is a bigger guard who can shoot lights out from anywhere on the floor. His shooting will space the floor well in the NBA, but he will need to get quicker and improve his defense and rebounding if he wants his NBA career to last.

(In fairness, he had to wait his turn behind Cole Aldrich and the Morris Twins) … Some view him as an older player beating up on players 2-3 years younger (on average) than himself … Scouts aren’t sold on his offensive abilities and question how effective he will be offensively at the next level … Lack of lateral quickness makes him a liability in pick and roll situations … Not great in the open floor. More effective playing in the half court. Appears very rigid, lower body awkward and uncoordinated … Has decent speed in the open floor, but some wonder if the big, slower center is a dinosaur in today’s NBA. Does Withey have the foot speed and athleticism to be as effective in the NBA as he is in college … Likely would have been a much better fit in 1990, than today’s NBA … Upperbody strength is average by NBA standards …

Has a 7-foot wingspan at 6-foot-6 … Excels in finishing at the rime and although his dominant hand is his right, has shown the ability to finish with his left …  Good ball handler with both the left and right hands …. Uses his superior length against smaller guards to get his shot off … Attacks the basket well off the dribble … Utilizes the spin move and deceptively quick first step to keep defenders on their heels …  Quick hands and feet on defense, plays the passing lanes well and is aggressive when attacking in transition … Solid lateral speed …  Willing passer with good vision on the break ….  Active player who always seems to be in good positioning to keep plays alive on the offensive end and break them up on defense …  Comes from a family with a great basketball pedigree as his Father, Sister and Uncle all played basketball at South Carolina with his Uncle having spent time in the NBA …
","Dozier’s NBA position remains up in the air at this point because he doesn’t necessarily have the shot for the shooting guard position and is far from a finished product in terms of his handle and vision for the point … Can play both with some consistency at times but will need to hone in his skill set to one or the other … Still needs to add some weight to his 6-7 frame … Shot just 28% from three point range for his career with the Gamecocks, something that he will have to improve upon as NBA defenders give him space and take away his ability to drive to the hoop … Is equally as inconsistent when spotting up or when pulling up off the dribble …  Free throw shooting is an issue, shot less than 60% from the charity stripe in both seasons at USC …  Mechanically, his jumper is sound so the consistency should get better over time … His lack of rebounding for a player his size and length is a bit alarming but he was playing the point a lot during his sophomore year so his 4.8 average may have been affected …
Overall: A Final Four run that came out of nowhere really helped enhance Dozier’s stock as he averaged 16 points and 5 boards a game for the Gamecocks … Has the build of a prototypical off guard at the next level but still maintains the play making ability of a PG, especially in the open court …  He’s still extremely raw on the offensive end of the floor and is learning how to play the PG position …  His ability to knock down shots consistently, or lack thereof, will be what makes or breaks him when it comes to his ability to play at the next level … Physically gifted player with the size, length and athleticism to play at the next level … Still not sure whether he is a true ""combo guard"" or whether he is a ""tweener"" …  Wasn’t really much of an impact player as a freshman but was arguably the team’s most important player as a sophomore even though teammate Sindarious Thornwell got most of the love down the stretch … Could be a steal late in the first round if he falls into the right situation and the right coaching staff that can find his ideal position and help him refine his skill set at that position … Intriguing prospect that should really help his stock during the NBA combine once team’s get a close up look at his athleticism and measurements.

Also sported a 9’ standing reach at the same event … 3rd Team All-Big 12, and Big 12 Newcomer of the Year as a Senior in 2014-15. 2nd Team All-American Conference as a Junior at Houston in 2013-14. 1st team Conference USA as a sophomore in 2012-13, and All Conference USA Freshman 1st Team as a freshman the year before.",5/29/15,"Thomas is a polished inside the arc scorer, both with his back to the basket and facing up out to about 15 feet, with good instincts, and a nice feel in terms of sizing up opponents 1 on 1 … He possesses a 7’2’’ wingspan, has good strength, and a wide frame that allows him to finish with both hands around the rim … Last season at Oklahoma he shot 70.1% at the rim, and took 50% of his shots close to the hoop (according to hoop-math.com) … Part of this high frequency of close shots comes due to his prowess as an offensive rebounder (2.2 per game) … Definitely a below the rim player, Thomas is great at boxing out, and using his strength, and frame to gain inside position against defenders. After playing his first 3 seasons at Houston, he also transitioned well into a complimentary role at OU, and this adaptability and knowledge of his game bodes well for a transition to an NBA role player … He’s also improved significantly from the free throw line since his freshman year. He raised his FT clip from 53% to 69% during his stint in college, and despite a slight dip in his percentage of 2 point jumpers (33.8%, according to data from hoop-math.com) as a Senior, his clip over his first 3 years was right around 40%, and TaShawn has face up and pick-and-pop potential in the NBA. He’s also a pretty solid post passer, and tallied 4 games of 4 or more assists last year as a Sooner … Thomas’ long arms, and good timing make him a surprisingly adequate shot blocker. A 9’ standing reach paired with his instinct, he blocked 262 shots during his 4 year NCAA career. 
","TaShawn’s biggest weakness is probably the fact that he’s just 6’8’’ in shoes and lacks the ball handling skills, 3 point range, and athletic ability to play the small forward spot … His length dimensions are really pretty solid, which helps make up for this, but his lack of high caliber leaping ability and quickness doesn’t do him any favors … His 3/4 court sprint, and agility drill were both in the bottom 10 of this year’s NBA combine participants … Lacks great speed and explosiveness … He’s definitely used to using his bulk to his advantage, but in the NBA where the game pace is faster, plus the games and seasons are longer, he’ll need to trim down the 12.4% body fat he measured in Chicago … He seems to be working on this as he measured in 4 pounds lighter at the combine than he did in April’s Portsmouth Invitational Tournament. 
Overall: TaShawn Thomas is a polished, mature player, with some NBA translatable skills as a face up 4 man, and a player who could really develop into an automatic mid-range shooter with more reps and experience as a professional … He is a tad undersized, and must improve his conditioning, but he knows his game, plays to his strengths, and doesn’t try to do too much … He’s also transitioned from a feature player at Houston, to an important cog on a very good Oklahoma team … This kind of maturity, and team attitude is often a good sign when looking for players to bring in as NBA reserves.

","Mitchell is a much better leaper off of two feet than one foot, and his explosiveness on his drives diminishes when he has to elevate off of one foot, especially when forced to his weaker left hand … He also doesn’t get all the way to the rim as one might expect, as shown by his low two-point field goal percentage (46%) and below average free throw rate (4 attempts per-40), especially when operating against strong defenses … Despite a big 6’10 wingspan, his 8’1 standing reach is very small for an NBA 2-guard … Mitchell is still working on transitioning from the wing to the combo guard spot … He made strides as a playmaker in his sophomore season and operating out of the pick and roll … However, he still plays too fast at times, not always reading the defense and making the simple play … He also lacks the ideal height and court vision to see over the top of the defense, especially with bigger opponents guarding him … Even though he has improved as a shooter, Mitchell is still a streaky shooter, mostly due to his subpar shot-selection … He has a tendency to settle for tough, contested two-point jumpers, partially due to his inability to consistently get all the way to the rim, and also because of his average decision making skills … While he can make some of these attempts, it will not be a reliable way to score at the next level, and it will decrease his overall offensive efficiency, as it has in college …

A former walk on, he was on UNC’s runner up and championship teams as a freshman and sophomore. Made the famous transition jumper in UNC’s 2017 Elite Eight game against UK. Had disappointing runs in 2018 and 2019 as a 2 and 1 seed.",6/16/19,"Decent 3-point shooter (36%, but only 29% senior year)… Great rebounder… Knows how to position himself under the rim… Has been on winning teams (lost in championship freshman year and won championship sophomore year)… Works hard off the court, strong work ethic… Works hard on the court, knows when and how to work for a rebound… Knows how to run the floor after four years in UNC’s transition offense… Crafty player. Great array of mid-range shots (runners, jumpers, floaters, fades) and uses the glass very well around the basket… Smart player, great positioning offensively… Decent passer out of the low post… Has experience handling the ball in UNC’s fast-paced offense… Can heat up quickly… Good, strong screener… Lots of hustle, goes to the floor and always gives his all … 
","Lacks speed in the opn floor and particularly laterally … he will really struggle to keep up with NBA athletes on the defensive end … Not a great athlete, will not outrun or out-jump anyone… Mediocre free throw shooter for his overall shooting ability (just 67% at UNC)… Not big or athletic enough to guard the four at the next level… Certainly not big enough to guard the NBA five position… Needs to prove he can consistently make the three (40% then 43% sophomore and junior year but 29% senior year)… Not very explosive and is forced to rely on the mid-range instead of getting to the basket … Not a shot blocker by any means … Disappears for stretches during games … Won’t be able to get off his shots as consistently with bigger defenders on him… Older player, not much room for improvement…
Outlook: Luke Maye is an extremely crafty and smart player, but he will have to prove that he can shoot the NBA 3 if he wants to make a roster … Maye could be a late second-rounder but will most likely go undrafted … His relative lack of explosiveness and athleticism forces him to rely on his creative mid-range game, but in the modern NBA he will have to play the stretch four role to earn minutes … Maye projects as an undersized rebounder in the NBA, but his defense will have to improve and he will have to find a consistent long range shot … If he can;t carve out a role in the NBA, he could potentially find a spot in Europe …

Runs pretty well for his size. Very alert on defense. Does a good job finding his man and going out to contest shooters on the perimeter. Does a good job on the boards (10.8 rebounds per game). Really solid fundamentals. Boxes out. Goes up to grab the ball with two hands and does a good job clearing space. Able to hold his own on the glass against DeAndre Ayton (11 points and 12 rebounds). Smart player. Does a good job of not forcing it. Commands the ball well in the post. Really improved his shooting during the course of his career. He shot 60.9% from the foul line as a freshman and shot 82.8% as a senior. Also came into UCLA with no 3-point shot and winded up being a 40.2% 3-point shooter on 3.4 attempts per game. Post moves have really improved. Capable of hitting jump hooks inside, etc. Averaged a career-high 12.6 points per game in his senior year. Did a good job of staying on the floor and not fouling (2.4 fouls per game in 33.2 minutes). 
","Not the most athletic big man. Athleticism is solid, but there are questions about his ability to hang with quicker, more athletic NBA bigs. His ability to hang with DeAndre Ayton is definitely encouraging. Solid scorer at UCLA, but not elite. Never the first option at UCLA. More of a third or fourth option kind of player. Not a bad shot blocker, but not great either (.9 blocks per game as a senior; 1.1 blocks per game for his career). His ability to protect to the rim needs to be better as a 7-footer. He’s good at a lot of things, but not great. Sort of a jack-of-all trades, master of none kind of player. 
Overall: While it took him some time to fully develop, Thomas Welsh leaves UCLA as a very solid, all-around big man. He can score both inside and out, hold his own inside on the glass, and he’s a smart player who rarely makes any mistakes. Guys like him have the chance to find a home in the NBA, especially if they are 7-feet.

","The obvious weakness is his size at just 5’9… Size will lead to difficulty on offense at the next level with larger more athletic rim protectors… Will have difficulty getting shots off over taller perimeter defenders… Will be difficult to be a good enough defender at the next level… His level of competition is questionable in the Big South… Was never able to lead his team to the NCAA tournament despite leading his team in scoring all four years… May be a product of the Campbell offense but was almost always looking to score and did not get teammates involved with just 2.6 assists per game in college… Will turn 22 in July, which is not that old, but lacks upside, teams know what they are going to be getting out of Clemons when they sign him…
Outlook: The point guard from Campbell will see difficulties in the league due to his size and will likely go undrafted as teams take chances on players with high upside. However, nobody can deny that Clemons can score the basketball whenever and however he wants. With a lethal shot, great handles and speed and incredible finishing ability, Clemons can score from anywhere on the floor without much help. If Clemons wants to make an impact at the next level, he will have to find a coach willing to put him into situations where he can succeed, as he will have difficulties if not surrounded by players who can space the floor as he goes to work on offense while rebounding and helping him defensively against larger NBA players.

Overall: Ellis found great individual successful during his four-year career as a Kansas Jayhawk. In his final three seasons, he became the focal point of the Jayhawks’ offense and didn’t fail to live up to increased expectations, earning two Big 12 All-Conference First-Team selections and a Consensus Second-Team All-American honor along the way. Off the court he took his academics very seriously as he also earned First-Team Academic Big 12 honors. The former McDonalds All-American made significant strides in his game each year after an underwhelming freshman season. As a senior, he averaged 16.9 points on 53 percent shooting and 5.8 rebounds. The Wichita, Kansas native is very skilled around the rim and has a great basketball IQ. He’s competitive on both ends of the floor, but offensively, he will need to continue to expand his game moving forward if he hopes to stick around in the NBA. Getting more comfortable playing on and defending the perimeter will go a long way toward determining what his potential is at the next level. The fact that he’s a tweener will also be a determining factor, as he seems too small to succeed as a power forward, but not athletic enough to play small forward. A lot of the success he may have will depend on favorable match-ups and if he’s used as a combo-forward in small ball lineups. As far as his draft stock, look for him to go anywhere from second round to undrafted. No matter what, he should get a chance to prove himself this summer as NBA teams will continually keep an eye out for his development.

Ellis’ high level footwork, which includes a number of pivot and spin based moves make him very effective with his back to the basket, and off the dribble … His mid range, and emerging long range jumper allow him to keep defenders honest, and render him a threat 5 feet or 20 feet away from the hoop … Ellis finished the season shooting 39% from the 3 point range, and a slow start to the year was erased after a red hot .476% three point shooting percentage over seventeen Big 12 games … Offensively he’s really a well rounded player capable of facing up, scoring with his back to the basket or putting the ball on the deck … Ellis is also a player who’s improved his athleticism over the years, and although not an elite athlete, he’s strong, has nice explosion, and very well conditioned … Ellis is a willing defender, and puts forth a great deal of effort … Not great defending on the low block, he can hold his own switching off pick and rolls, and defending away from the hoop … Also a solid rebounder, he hauled in 6.9 per game in 28.8 mpg … Perry is also a very high character player, who has clearly worked hard to improve his game and conditioning every season in college … 
","Ellis does fit into the tweener mold … Not quite big enough to be an ideal power forward in the NBA, and there are questions as to whether he is athletic enough to play NBA small forwards … He measured just 6’8’’ in shoes, and weighs 222 lbs, with a 6’10’’ wingspan … All pretty small measurements for an NBA 4 man … He does struggle to finish over length … Often choses to go head on into double teams rather than making the smarter decision to pass to an open teammate … Perry is an improved ball handler, but to play minutes in the NBA at small forward, he’ll need to continue to hone these skills … Must work on extending his very good collegiate 3 point clip out to the NBA line … 
Overall: Ellis is a high character combo forward, nearly complete on the offensive end. A savvy NCAA vet, he’s faced his fair share of players currently in the NBA over the years, and had success, but his lack of height and still evolving ball handling skills still lump him in group of players that are labeled “tweeners.” … His improved athleticism and conditioning are not jaw dropping, but are certainly acceptable when looking at an NBA forward … Despite his lack of high level physical tools, he’s a player who works hard on the defensive end, and understands team defensive schemes …

In his senior year, Curry shot a scorching 44% from deep on 6.2 3-point attempts per game, easily making him one of the most prolific shooters at the college level … Improved his shot off the dribble and ability to move without the ball a great deal while at Duke … Shows a great mid range game and improved his field goal percentage tremendously from his junior to senior year, 42% and 46.5% respectively … A crafty player that has many jab step, pump fake, and hesitation moves in his arsenal to get open and score … Shows a winning attitude and intangibles to overcome the odds, and possibly make it as an undersized NBA prospect … Being related to the best shooter in the league never hurt anyone. Being a Curry should help push him over the top if teams are torn between Curry and another player in the 2nd round …
","At 6’1 and only 180 pounds without length; Curry does not have the size or athleticism necessary for the NBA SG position … What will really hurt Curry at the next level is his lack of point guard skills/instincts … At his size, it’s essential that Curry be able to handle the PG position, at least in spot duty. Which to this point he has been unable to show … His lack of strength and athleticism will make him a liability on defense guarding 1s and particularly 2s … He does not have great foot speed or quickness. Before Quinn Cook’s emergence at Duke this year, Curry was forced to play point during the 2011-2012 season. It was a good learning experience, but it also exposed Curry’s deficiencies … Despite dominating the ball, Curry only averaged 2.4 assists per game with a 1.1-1 assist to turnover ratio … Curry will also not be able to get to the line as much as he did in his college career without adding a lot of strength. His lack of size, strength and athleticism limits his ability to finish at the rim …

","He’s still skinny even if he has worked on his muscular structure, there’s still room for improvement, he’ll definitely struggle against standard NBA big man … He lacks elite explosiveness and this affects his offensive effectiveness, with most of his game is below the rim, despite his elite size and length … Even with soft hands, his shooting mechanics are not too efficient, lacking fluidity and quickness on his release …  He still needs to work on fundamentals in terms of boxing out, rebounding and defending the low-post, where he struggles the most due to his lack of physical strength, being often bounced back by stronger opponents … He lacks balance and solid moves in post position, which leads to frequent turnovers (travelling violations, offensive fouls) during half-court game he’s called to play in sets starting from the painted area … He’s just an average shot-blocker and defensive rebounder … Compared with his height, the intimidation he brings could be much better … The level of competition he’s currently facing (Russian Superleague) is really low, he should be tested at a higher level of competition … The cultural and character features of the prototypical Russian players clash with USA sports environment, and the historical track record is not encouraging from this standpoint (Monia, Khryapa, Korolev) …

","Sustaining a high level of intensity and focus is his biggest obstacle … Jones laid back attitude often manifests itself on the court, and his inability to consistently play to his ability is a concern … He often disappears from games and currently lacks the tenacity needed to be a dominant presence inside … Success will likely be highly contingent on landing in the right situation with coaches that understand how to build his confidence and get the most out of his abilities … Competitiveness and feel for the game comes into question … It is baffling how poorly (6.9 per game) he rebounds for someone with his physical attributes … Post skills have not progressed as expected and still need work … Has the length and hops to be a real presence inside, but doesn’t really have the rebounding numbers or defensive prowess to show for it … Had a tough time emerging as Vanderbilt’s clearcut star, depite being the best talent … Jones productivity and efficiency (scoring, FG%, FT%, minutes) decreased accross the board as a junior … He gets to the line at a decent rate, but struggled to convert once there … Regressed as a free throw shooter last year, connecting on a college career-low 54% from the stripe … Needs to work on becoming a bigger presence on both ends of the floor … Commits a fair amount of turnovers with a lack of significant assist numbers … Not particularly adept at passing out of double-teams … Despite having a very strong frame, can be pushed around at times, so adding some lower body strength and especially toughness will be key … 
Overall: Jones is a springy, skilled center who has the potential to make an impact at the next level, but often struggled to consistently make an impact at the college level … He’ll need to become more tenacious and a bit stronger in order to find the consistency to stick in an NBA rotation, but the framework is there and he’s by all accounts considered a high character kid …

","Very emotional player, who at time lets his emotions distract him … His attitude and body language on the court make him look a little cocky, or immature … He is just an above average athlete  … Jumps almost exclusively off two feet and needs some time to gather before he does, which will probably be a problem at the next level … Has incisostent shooting mechanics, since he changes his release point when he is closely guarded … Seems to have problems finishing in the paint against physical opponents, with the main problem being that he doesn’t always go strong to the basket and settles for floaters and finesse moves … Misses a lot of easy lay ups, which is something you don’t expect from someone with his talent … He may have the ability to become a great stretch-big in the future, but he can’t do this at a consistent level yet due to his incosistent shooting … Has to improve his free throw percentage, which for now is in the 65-72% rate … He is out of control with the ball in his hand at times, trying to do too much … Turnover prone, mainly because he either looks for the flashy move rather than just making the right play, or because he has the tendency to telegraph his passes… He loses his concentration on Defense and forgets assignments … Has problems defending the Pick-n-Roll, because he often either over commits to the ball handler or leaves after the player he is guarding sets the pick … Gets in foul trouble too often … He doesn’t have the length or the athletic ability to be considered an elite rim protector … He doesn’t know the law of verticality on defense just yet, which is something that could help him … Has a tendency to put his hands down when he tries to block a shot and he is whisted for a lot of fouls because of it … It’s questionable whether he will be able to guard athletic stretch power forwards at the next level… 
Overall: Hartenstein is one of the best bigs of his generation in Europe. His combination of size, skillset and versatility is difficult to ignore, since he can become a great inside-out player. He is still a work in progress though and he needs to continue working in all aspects of his game

","Petteway is a high-volume shooter who isn’t always the most efficient player on the court.  His shooting percentage was under 40% last season … Takes a lot of long pull-up jumpers from inside the arc, which is one of the least efficient shots one can take … He’s very confident but at times, it can be over confidence as he forces bad shots … All in all, he’s overly reliant on pull-up jumpers, although part of his shot selection woes can be attributed to the fact that Nebraska had very few viable offensive options … Can be too aggressive at times, to the point of being out of control … Averaged a whopping 3.4 turnovers per game last season, a huge number for a non-point guard … Not a standout athlete … His combine numbers were very underwhelming, though his wingspan helps him … His standing vert and max vert were both the fifth-lowest of 49 players measured at the combine, which includes plenty of big men … Also was determined to be fairly skinny at the combine, weighing in at 209 lbs … Granted, he’s fearless attacking the rim and gets a fair amount of highlight jams, all things considered … His body fat was very low, but he may need to put on muscle to guard NBA 3’s, as he may lack the quickness to guard NBA 2’s … Has a slight tendency to get lost on defense off the ball … Not a great free throw shooter for how often he gets to the line.  Shot 71% from the stripe last season. Not horrible but must improve …

","Can he continue to develop as a point guard? … Not overly explosive but he does possess some explosiveness … Struggles with his shot selection … Needs to take more efficient shots … Questionable decision-making leads to an overall lack of offensive efficiency … Seems to play at an extremely high level of intensity in spurts, but not sure he is able to sustain that over an 82 game season … Tries to drive to the rim when there’s too many defenders in the paint … Needs to work on shooting/shot making consistency, especially from the 2-point/mid-range … Mid-range game is a work in progress … Isn’t a good enough three-point shooter to rely on that part of his game … Settles for too many stepback jumpers at times … Has no rhythm on his spot-up/catch-and-shoot jumpers … Shot 38% from the field, including 36 percent from 3-point range last season … His shooting mechanics are inconsistent … Has trouble finishing in the paint and around the basket against length … His questionable decision-making affects him greatly when trying to score in traffic … He’s turnover prone because of his tendency to force bad passes….Often has tunnel vision … Defensively, he’ll need to improve on his lateral quickness … Has room for improvement in his defensive awareness and fundamentals … Lack of length is concerning on the defensive end at the next level … Will he be as versatile at the next level? His size may limit how much he can play at the shooting guard position … Sometimes plays out of control … 
Overall: Whitehead, 21, is coming off a successful sophomore season at Seton Hall in which he led the program to its first Big East Tournament championship since 1993 … He also led the Pirates to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 10 years … The Brooklyn native averaged 18.2 points, 5.1 assists, 3.6 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, 1.2 steals, and 2.4 three-point field goals made in 32.3 minutes of action per game … After an injury-riddled freshman season, Whitehead was named to the First Team All-Big East and the Big East Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player this past season … He started to see the success that many thought he would have after coming to Seton Hall as a McDonald’s All-American and top-20 prospect in the class of 2014 … Whitehead showed a lot of improvement from his freshman to sophomore season … He showcased his all-around game as the team’s primary point guard, including his ability to hit the three, facilitate and defend, and has solid physical gifts standing at 6-foot-4, 210-pounds with a 6’8.75” wingspan … Scouts are concerned with his offensive efficiency, including his subpar mid-range game and struggles with finishing against length in traffic, and decision-making … Although there are some holes in his game like most young players, Whitehead does have NBA potential and should continue to show that he’s worthy of a late first-round or early second-round pick …

","Hasn’t been tested at a high level, playing at senior level for just a couple of months before declaring for the NBA Draft … His lack of experience and exposure at high level leads to some wild decisions, costly turnovers and losing assignments on both ends of the floor, but that was inevitable … Decision making can be iffy at times… He is a good, but not an elite athlete … He must bulk up his body … Has an average wingspan (measured at 6-6 feet, which is also his height) … Doesn’t have the necessary burst on his first step to beat his man on isolation situations … His average first step makes it difficult for him to exploit miss-matches when he is guarded by a Big … Left hand dominant for now, which makes him predictable… Ball handling with his right hand needs polishing … His pull up game is a work in progress, since he changes his shooting mechanics in that situation, rushing his shot … For now he can probably considered a streaky shooter … Has problems finishing through contact due to weak upper body … Limited on half court settings due to his limitations, he needs space to be effective … At times he looks too willing to pass the ball, losing opportunities to score the ball … He hasn’t find the right balance between being a scorer and a facilitator, being better at the later … Occasionally he moves too fast when he doesn’t have the ball in his hands, and just cuts to the basket, which can create spacing problems, since he leads his defender straight to a teammate … He can lose focus on defense when he isn’t guarding the ball … Over commits as a help defender, even when he defends from the strong side, leaving his man open … Has problems chasing his man around screens and gets caught up behind them …
Overall: Joshua Obiesie is an athletic combo guard who made some noise the first couple of months of 2019… The German prospect has great size for a guard, but it’s his versatility on both ends of the floor, his high basketball I.Q and natural instincts that make him intriguing … His passing ability, improving shooting and defensive potential make him look like a future NBA player … At the same time, he needs to improve considerably in just about every area of his game, especially on his ball handling with his weak – right – hand, his shooting off the dribble, and earn playing time at a high level … If he manages to improve his flaws, he can become a really interesting player.

Rebounding is another area where Tokoto’s athleticism comes into play … His ability to get off the ground quickly on both his first and second jumps means he’s constantly around the ball … Tokoto isn’t a great ball handler, but showed the ability to grab a rebound and then initiate the fastbreak … The final area where Tokoto shines is in transition … His combination of length, speed and athleticism make him a consistent threat to finish the break … His attacks to the basket often ended above the rim … If he wasn’t finishing he often made the right play whether it was an outlet pass or finding the open man … Very good at moving off the ball and finding lanes to cut through …
","Jump shot needs major work, needs to rework his entire form from feet to release … Shot an abysmal 54 percent from the free throw line over three years … It was even more ghastly from deep, where he shot 26 percent for his career … Needs to become better attacking the basket from the left side of the floor, very right-hand dominant … Has to get more comfortable creating his own shot … Committed the fourth-most turnovers (86) in conference play las season … Had a tendency to play in spurts, must become more consistent in his overall play … Should lock himself in the weight room during his rookie season as he is to thin, weighed 196 lbs at 2015 Draft Combine to become the supreme defender that he has the skills to be … Settled too often for midrange jumpers … Fell too often for pump fakes, especially on players that weren’t great shooters …

","He can be very inconsistent with his offensive production … Nice athlete, but not ""standout"" … Not as explosive as his counterparts … Ball-handling can improve, especially in the half-court … Improvement in his ball-handling with help him with getting all the way to the basket more consistently on his drives … Needs to work more on driving and finishing with his left hand … Shooting form/stroke looks unorthodox at times … Instead of shooting the ball he tends to fling it … Release point should be higher … For being such a streaky and inconsistent shooter, he  sometimes relies on his jump shot too heavily … Prone to going ice cold from the field and disappearing offensively during games … Shooting efficiency needs improvement … Doesn’t always show that he has a good feel for the game … Richardson will force the issue on some possessions … Leading to silly turnovers and bad shot selections … Needs to work on getting good shots off within the flow of his team’s offense … Overall decision-making needs to improve … A few years older than most players in his class because he reclassified … 
Overall: Richardson, a former McDonald’s All-American and Jordan Brand Classic selectee, averaged 13.3 points on 36 percent shooting, 4.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists while starting every game this season for Syracuse … The freshman saw his draft stock rise after putting up a string of solid performances throughout the NCAA Tournament, including scoring 23 points – 21 in the second half – to lead the Orange to comeback victory over Virginia in the Elite Eight. He also scored 17 points in the team’s Final Four loss to North Carolina. Although Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim often got on Richardson for his poor shot selection, he was able to make up for it by playing well when it mattered the most. In a nutshell, Richardson is an attacking guard and a streaky shooter who can shoot the lights out on any given night. If his ball-handling, decision-making and overall shooting consistency continues to improve then he can be terrific scorer at the next level. He’s a bit of a raw talent but has a ton of upside and will likely get selected mid-to-late first round of this year’s draft if he decides to not return for his sophomore season.

","The obvious weakness is that he doesn’t have a defined position … He lacks athleticism at the wing, and he’s small for a post player with short arms … Regardless of where he plays he’s going to be at an athletic disadvantage due to poor lateral quickness and being a less athletic player … After shooting excellent from deep as a freshman, he has struggled from 3 this season, though his numbers have picked up as the season has progressed … 
Overall: Warren has responded very well to his expanded role for the Wolfpack this year … He worked very hard to get better and you can tell with his improved offensive game and athleticism.

Stefanos Makris 6/20/18
Strenghts: What’s most impressive about him is the maturity and the polish and completeness of his game at just 16 years of age, basically from all standpoints … As a 6-7 SG, he already has a solid body, ready to compete at the senior level, with a wide frame, quite developed from a muscular standpoint, both his upper and lower body … He has shown a remarkable amount of pro moves and amazing body control during his first season with the Real Madrid senior team … His game is already defined and complete, with the ability to create his own shot basically in any kind of situation: midrange game, layups, floater, three pointers are all an effective part of his offensive repertoire … Furthermore his court vision and ball handling skills are above average, with the ability to create for himself and his teammates in traffic often showing glimpses of rare talent … He often switches as the primary ball handler, where he can show his creativity and ability to attack the basket … Defensively he has quick hands and instincts in the passing lanes, with a great attitude and a blue collar style … Definitely one of the brightest prospects coming from Europe in a number of years … 
Weaknesses:  His biggest flaw is his lack of quickness and lateral speed, which affects his effectiveness in 1 on 1 defense against more explosive opponents … Furthermore this also limits his offensive effectiveness in ISO situations when he has to rely on his body control and fakes to create the space for the shot or to draw contact … He also needs to work on shot consistency, especially his mechanics and foot positioning … Sometimes he lacks the killer instinct when facing weaker opponents …

","He is an average athlete, which may prove to be problematic when competing against stronger, faster wings … Underwhelming speed and athleticism … Somewhat between posiitons as a 3/4 without a great ablity to defend either position … Tends to hoist up questionable shots … Often forces the action with the shot clock winding down, tossing up a difficult 3-pointer … For the amount of 3-point attempts he takes per game (6.1), he could improve some in that area, shooting 37.4% from beyond the arc as a sophomore … Needs to bulk up his thin frame or else he may get pushed around by more physical players at the next level … Not particularly quick laterally, and lack of a quick first step couldl imit his offensive effectiveness … 1.3 assists to 2.4 turnovers shows that he needs to get better at protecting the ball.

Outlook: After just averaging 5.7 points per game as a freshman, Nwora was not on anyone’s radar at the start of the 2018-19 season … His increased playing time as a sophomore and cementing himself as Louisville’s go-to guy has molded him into a potential first round for the 2019 NBA Draft …

Wooden Award and the Karl Malone Award… Pac-12 All-Tournament Team member… Two-time Pac-12 Player of the Week",6/17/17,"Markkanen was one of the top freshmen in college basketball last season, despite a middle of the year shooting slump, scoring 15.6 points per game on 42% shooting from beyond the arc … Markkanen’s combination of size and skill makes him one of the more intriguing prospects in the draft, and he will have the chance to develop into a valued stretch-four man in the Association … He is mature young man and appeared to be an exceptionally focused and likable teammate in his one year at Arizona … Markkanen’s upside starts with his outstanding size for an NBA power forward at 7-0 and 230 pounds … He is a fluid athlete with great coordination for his size … Most of the intrigue with him, however, is his unique offensive skillset … Markkanen is a high-IQ player that knows how to play the game very efficiently … As mentioned above, Markkanen shot 42% from distance on 5.9 attempts per 40 minutes, and he may actually be the best shooter in this draft regardless of position … He has smooth mechanics, a soft touch, and good balance off the catch … He is not only lethal off the catch, but he is also a prolific shooter on the move off of screens, pull-ups, face-up jumpers out of the post, etc … He particularly showed these abilities off earlier in the year when teammate Allonzo Trier was out for the earlier part of the season, causing him to play a lot of small forward and rely on more perimeter scoring … With more spacing at the NBA level, he will be a tremendous pick and pop threat and be able to maximize his shooting ability … Markkanen moves well without the ball when looking to spot up from the perimeter, and he knows how to find the open spot on the arc to get off a good look … His mechanics also stay consistent even when his shot is contested … He always gets his feet under him and does not waste any motion from catch to release … He runs off of screens like a guard, as he gets his feet set quickly and appears to be very comfortable rising into his shot here … In addition, he has great footwork when chased off the three-point line and can effortlessly shoot the ball off the dribble, especially going to his left … He even showed flashes of pull-up jumpers as a pick and roll ball handler in his arsenal, something extremely rare for his size … His agility for his 7-0, 238 pound frame jumps out, as he is decently effective off the bounce, which will be key for him going forward when defenders chase him off the arc … He has a pretty quick first step that is definitely good enough to get by many of the players that will be guarding him in the NBA … He is very good going to his left with the ability to put it on the floor and finish going left just as comfortably as he does with his right … Markkanen is not a high level athlete, but he can finish above the rim in space due to his superior height and decent leaping ability for his size … He also does a solid job of attacking the offensive glass for a stretch-four man … He does a great job of stepping out and hedging ball screens as well, a situation he will probably be in quite often in today’s pick and roll heavy NBA. Markkanen’s role in the NBA will be clearly defined as a stretch-four man, who can thrive in the role of instant offense off the bench or something along the lines of what Ryan Anderson brings to Houston …

","As skilled as Markkanen is on the offensive end, he offers nowhere near the same potential on defense … His lack of strength is a major soncern as he gets toseed around pretty easily by NCAA bigs and already has filled out with broad shoulders … His core and leg strength need a lot of work, and may never allow him to battle inside against the NBA’s top post players … He does not have great length, limiting his ability to protect the rim, and being thin for his height, he plays a lot smaller than his size … He may be more of a mismatch as a stretch-five man on offense, but the flip side is that he may not have any chance to slow down most centers on the defensive end … As mentioned, Markkanen’s lack of a strong base hinders his ability to battle for position in the post … He is also not very physical down low, and he does not have the length to contest shots from other post players to make up for his inability to fight for good position … Combine his lack of length with just average timing and instincts, and he could be a potential liability on this end of the court … On the perimeter he has good feet, but he has a tendency to bend his back instead of his knees to get down in his stance, which eliminates some lateral quickness and effectiveness … He is a nightmare to guard as a stretch-four on offense, but he often gets lost when trying to defend opposing stretch-fours on the perimeter … His intincts in defending the pick and roll and knowing when to come help from the weak side also needs to improve … His rebounding ability is also less than stellar for many of the same reasons that his defensive upside is limited … Markkanen averaged an underwhelming 9.3 rebounds per 40 minutes, as he lacks the length, range, and toughness to be a force in this department … He does not always work hard to get great position when the shot goes up, nor does he have the necessary frame to push opposing big men out of position … Scouts also question how much more there really is to his offensive game than just his shooting ability … He does not appear to have much of a post game, other than simple jump hooks and turnaround jumpers and is not a great finisher in traffic … Not the most vocal or demonstrative person, will need to work on being more assertive and vocal on the floor … He also is not a very gifted playmaker at this stage (1.2 assists per 40 minutes) and he goes left most times he puts the ball on the floor … He is much better attacking off the dribble from the catch than in isolation situations, and he does not look nearly as natural shooting the ball when going to his right hand … Aside from the defensive concerns, he also must develop his offensive repertoire outside of his jump shot.

","His wingspan is average and that limits him on both ends of the floor… He is a good but not an elite athlete… He needs time to gather before jumping and that could hurt him at the next level… He could add a little more weight to be able to stand the physicality of the next level… His back to the basket game isn’t completely there yet… He doesn’t always establish position in the post and has problems doing it against physical players… He could improve his ball handling to be more effective on Isolation situations… His shooting mechanics are excellent, but his shooting release is a little slow, which gives his opponents time to contest his shot… Consistency is an issue, since he still has the tendency to disappear for long stretches of games … At times he is a little passive on offense and doesn’t always ask for the ball… Just an average passer for now… Off ball Defense needs work, since at times he is too focused on the ball and loses sight of the player he is guarding… He must improve on Post Defense, learn how to use his body and not get bullied by physical players… Weak side defense is also an issue since at times he is just a step too slow to help… It’s really difficult to imagine him becoming an elite shot blocker due to his average wingspan and inability to jump high from a standing position … He has problems defending when he is asked to switch and has to guard an explosive perimeter player since his lateral quickness is just OK for now…
Overall: Markkanen is a player to keep an eye on. At first glance he looks like a prototypical Stretch-4, but he can become a lot more than just that. His ability to score from just about everywhere on the floor is what makes him special, but he has all the necessary tools to become a two-way player. With that said, he still has long ways to go in many aspects of the game, especially on Defense, but if he continues working hard he can become a very good player in the future. Likely will need some adjustment time to playing against American athletes …

Clutch performer who seems to shine when it matters most … A tremendous leader. Relishes the opportunity to take the club on his back and carry them to victory … Shows great consistency. Comes to play every game and had just a small handful of games where he didn’t score at least 15 points … While scoring is his forte, his ability to run the team and make plays for others, as well as maintaining above a 3-to-1 ast/to ratio is enough to label him a legitimate point guard … Has really evolved as a floor general, dictating the tempo and showing the patience to allow plays to develop and find teammates … A strong ball handler, though not elite level … Shows the ability to find teammates on drive and kicks … Tremedous in pick and roll situations … His numbers show how effective he is averaging 18.9 ppg, 47% from the floor, 39% from 3, 80% from the line, and a 6.8 to 2.2 a/to ratio … Validated his 3 point shooting ability by hitting a high volume (2 per game) … Has a surprising 6’5 wingspan, giving him some additional length to get shots off and finish at the rim … A pesky defender showing excellent ability to anticipate an opposing guard’s next move and get his hands in to strip the ball away … Shows solid body strength giving him the ability to stay on balance when contact occurs and finish off drives … Very effective in catch and shoot situations, playing off the ball … Also tremendous pulling up for shots off the dribble …
","Undersized for the PG position and could struggle some to compete with bigger, quicker and more athletic point guards at the NBA level … Scouts worry that he may run into similar problems as 2011 top 10 pick Kemba Walker: having many passes deflected due to his size and having to work twice as hard (defensively and getting shots off) on a game to game basis due to his size. Can he be a starting PG, and if so can he do it on on a winning team? Due to being undersized, these questions must be asked … He doesn’t show the jitterbug quickness to gain separation on quicker guards which is a concern considering his size … Not the most athletic guard. Solid but not spectacular. Not a player that will dunk in traffic or be a dynamic finisher … His numbers show that he’s more effective in the half court than in transition … A better scorer than distributor, though his vision and passing ability shows flashes … Despite averaging 6.8 apg, scouts aren’t completely sold on his vision and ability to make everyone around him better … Needs to work on his pick and roll skills … As clutch a player as he is, his ISO ability is compromised by a lack of elite speed off the dribble and average first step … Much more effective going to his right. Will need to work on using his left hand and ability to go left in order for team’s not to overplay him to one side, limiting his effectiveness … Should look to add a tear drop to his arsenal.

He also does not have a very reliable mid range game or off the dribble jumper … As a projected four man, he will need to be more dependable in this area … It would probably help him to cut some of the motion out of his shot, as he tends to dip the ball all the way to his waist before getting into his release … He is a capable playmaker off the dribble, but his handle is a bit loose … Right now he is limited to mostly just straight line drives and is not great at making multiple moves or changing direction to create for himself … He can improve his feel in the low post, as he does not always do a great job of reacting to how the defense is playing him and seems too often to have his mind made up before he makes his move … He can also improve his shot selection … The three-point shot is not his greatest strength at this stage, but he will occasionally launch deep, low percentage shots from the perimeter, and also drives into traffic out of control too frequently … Kuzma has good vision but does not always play with his head up, which mitigates this ability … He can be forced into turnovers because of this, and he needs to do a better job of making the simple play instead of trying to force the issue … Kuzma was an adequate finisher in college but it will be a big adjustment against NBA length and athleticism; relies more on fluidity than explosiveness and struggles to elevate in traffic … He does not have the requisite size to compensate for his average explosiveness, and he will have to rely on touch and craftiness … He is a capable finisher through contact but struggles more with long defenders, which he will see much more regularly in the NBA; not a great stand still leaper; has good length and mobility at 6’9” but is not as effective defensively as he probably should be … He plays too upright on the perimeter causing him to struggle staying in front of smaller players … He can improve his toughness and develop more of a killer instinct on that end … He can get bullied inside, needs to do a better job of stopping the offensive player’s first move and force him to change directions … He does not show consistent effort when closing out on the perimeter, often too upright and will allow players to put the ball on the floor with his strong hand without showing much resistance … He struggles to contain the ball and usually will not attempt to make a play at the rim when beaten off the dribble … He can also get lost too often when he is off the ball; needs to do a better job of seeing both his man and the ball simultaneously … He can be a bit soft inside, and should be a much better shot blocker with his length … Motivation level remains a question mark.

contact, but his body isn’t really ready to withstand it just yet … Has problems against physical defenders and he even had problems at the junior level against less physical opponents … He settles for bad shoots when he has to go against physical defenders… Occasionally he just stands still on the perimeter waiting, not doing anything … Decision making can be iffy at times … Some of his moves on the post aren’t “clean” enough, since he can rush things … Has the tendency to go in to traffic after attacking a close out defense, giving the impression that he has decided what to do from the beginning … He can turn from either shoulder while posting up, but in reality he prefers to turn on his left shoulder, which can make his game predictable … Turnover prone, he might telegraph passes, or try passes that just aren’t there … For the time being he is not strong enough to guard power forwards and doesn’t have the necessary lateral quickness to guard wings … Bigger opponents can bully him in the post and score on him because of the difference in strength … Doesn’t always have a low stance on defense and depends too much on his athleticism … Perimeter defense is an issue, since he gets beat by quick and explosive players… Has problems guarding the Pick and Roll because of his average lateral quickness and occasionaly lethargic approach on defense…
Overall: Luka Samanic is an extremely talented combo forward … On paper he can do just about everything on the offensive end of the floor and this is the main reason there has been so much buzz around him the last couple of years … At the same time, his questionable motor is probably the biggest concern … If he manages to stay motivated and focused, the future could be bright for him, since he has all the necessary tools to become a very good player …

He doesn’t necessarily needs to be a great athlete to succeed in the League, but it will for sure make his life harder when he will have to score in the paint … I’m not sure that he can finish so easily over NBA bigs, he will have to take his mid-range game to an even higher level … And it will make his life a lot harder on the defensive end where he will have to show the ability to stay in front of his opponents … His lateral speed and foot speed aren’t where a NBA coach would like to have it but the strength of his upper body could help to handle the contact … The other knock on his game is how inconsistent he is as a 3pts shooter and particularly on close out situations … According to synergy in those situations when the defender is recovering on him he tends to shoot 81% of the time with very low percentages: 28%, well below average for a guard and clearly not the numbers you would expect from a player like him … He needs to become a much more consistent shooter or decision maker on close outs to be successful in the NBA, where particularly initially he will have to take advantage of those opportunities to show his value before having screens and plays run for him …

Last season Carr shot just 32 percent from downtown on three attempts per game … This year, however, he has ascended his three-point percentage all the way to 46 percent and has done so on just under six attempts per game . Carr’s improved three-point shot has opened up the rest of his offensive arsenal, which allowed prompted him average a Big Ten best 19.9 points per game this season … Carr has very good size and length for a lead guard at 6-5 and can get shots off over smaller defenders … He is an excellent shot creator off the dribble and has become a serious threat to score in the mid-range area via pull-ups, step backs, spin dribbles, etc … When he gets inside the arc he does a great job of using his size and length to shoot over the top of smaller defenders … Carr also can take other guards down in the post, where he is comfortable operating as a scorer or playmaker … He has proficient scoring instincts and understands how to get to spots where he is most effective in different situations … Carr has also improved as a pick-and-roll ball handler and plays with nice patience in the half-court. Rarely does he get too sped up or out of control when coming off of ball screens … Carr is a capable playmaker as well and has improved his assist to turnover ratio in his sophomore season … When he keeps his eyes up and does not try to force the issue, he has shown flashes of solid vision … Carr is a good free-throw shooter as well, at nearly 80 percent for the second season in a row … He his size and length, he has some defensive upside as well, despite not being the most explosive vertical athlete … If he can learn to become more active with his hands on the ball, he could be a guy that records a lot of steals and blocks … Carr is also a good rebounder for a lead guard, averaging nearly five boards per game in each of his first two seasons … He is also clearly not afraid of the big moment, as he made some big time shots late in games this season, most notably to beat Ohio State on the road and one to tie it regulation against Minnesota with time winding down … 
","Carr lacks elite burst off the dribble and does not always explode to the basket when he turns the corner … He is also not the most explosive leaper, which hinders his ability to finish at the rim at times … That will limit his defensive upside in the NBA, as he is not quite big enough to guard NBA two-guards, but he does not have the lateral quickness to consistently stay in front of the dynamic point guards that he will see most nights in the pros … Carr also struggles to score against more physical defenders … Despite having a solid 6-5 foundation to work with, he checks in under 210 pounds and can be pushed off his spots fairly easily, so he will need to add some strength at the next level … There are questions if Carr’s improved shooting may be a bit of a fluke … Mechanically, there are no glaring hitches to his release, but his ball does not have great rotation … Will he be able to get away with this behind a deeper NBA three-point line? The biggest knock on Carr at this stage is his inefficiency … Last year he shot just 37 percent from the field, and while he did improve this season, he still made only a pedestrian 41 percent of his field goal attempts … Carr is much more of a volume scorer, as he had to take a lot of shots from the field in many of his high-scoring games this season … A big reason for that is he does not get to the free-throw line at a high rate … For the second season in a row, Carr attempted just 4.8 free throw attempts per game, which is indicative of his tendency to settle for contested jump shots at times … His shot selection needs some work, as he is a bit ball dominant and often tries to play hero ball instead of running the offense like you typically want from a true point guard … The other major concern with Carr is that, outside of his perimeter shooting, he really has not improved substantially in any area since last year … Obviously, he scored the ball at a higher rate this year, but he made just marginal strides as both a playmaker and a defender … With his limited athleticism, he is going to have to become more than just a volume scorer if he plans to carve out any substantial role for an NBA team …

","While Karnowski has great size, his athleticism and agility are below average at best … He relies primarily on his massive frame rather than footwork to gain position in the post … His lack of quickness also hinders his ability to get to the free-throw line at a high rate … In four seasons with the ‘Zags, he has never averaged more then 3.4 free throw attempts per contest … When he has gotten to the line, he has never converted consistently (below 60% for career) despite showing nice touch … His lack of adequate quickness and athleticism will lead to numerous limitations on the defensive end at the next level … He struggles to defend quicker and/or more athletic offensive players, and he does not provide much support as a rim protector … His insufficient foot speed can also lead to quick fouls … On the other end of the court, while he has good touch around the basket and solid footwork, he lacks an array of counter moves to utilize … In the NBA, defenders will be bigger, faster, and more athletic, so it will be imperative for him to further expand his low post arsenal … In the national championship game against North Carolina, his inability to score against the superior length and athleticism of the Tar Heels’ frontcourt was evident. Karnowski’s greatest weaknesses in the eyes of NBA teams, however, may have little to do with his skillset … He missed almost all of the 2015-16 season after having back surgery … NBA GMs are always wary of injury-prone big men (e.g. Greg Oden, Joel Embiid, etc.) Another factor Karnowski has working against him is his age. He will be almost 24 by the start of the 2017-18 NBA season, and most NBA teams will opt for the upside of a younger player … While he may be able to contribute for an NBA team, there are simply too many GMs who would be unwilling to select an older center with a history of back problems …

Overall: Anderson is a big, versatile intriguing prospect with great guard skills and length.  When he has the ball at the top of the key, reading the defense over the head of a smaller defense, he just seems to be in control of the game.  He lacks NBA-caliber athleticism and isn’t always consistent with his jump shot but he’s definitely a prospect that lots of teams will want to get their hands on…

Considered by some as the best athlete to surface in 10 years, since LeBron James. Will he develop the work ethic to maximize those abilities is the question … A virtual lock as a top 3 pick with a chance to go first depending on who gets the selection …",4/20/14,"Off the charts run/jump athleticism … Lateral quickness and length also gives him great potential as a perimeter defender, along with versatility to guard both wing positions efficiently … Incredibly dangerous in transition opportunities, long strider with a quick first step, did a great job of scoring or getting fouled when getting out in transition … Shooting mechanics have improved greatly, with quickness enough to get his shot off under tight defense … Got to the FT stripe at a good rate, making 77.5% of his attempts … As an offensive rebounder, can keep possessions alive that very few others can due to his second jump and tremendous leaping ability … Challenged defensively at Kansas, often asked to guard the other teams leading scorer on the wing, doing an admirable job … Unselfish, will look for teammates and is an evolving playmaker … Spin move can become a major weapon in isolation, plus has shown a floater that over time could become a weapon … When being closely defended, his step back jumper has also been a move that is tough to guard … Plays with a quiet intensity and while some question his lack of emotion, also never gets to down … When he has been challenged, has shown an ability to step up to the challenge … Son of a former NBA player and an Olympic sprinter, has an understanding of the game and a knowledge of where to get to on the court … Conditioning is fantastic, played major minutes as a freshman and should be able to carry a solid work load immediately … Ability to run the floor is elite and ensures a certain level of success at NBA level …  Very skinny but has the broad shoulders to add weight if he’s determined to … Showed an increased understanding of his role and got much lower on defense as the year progressed at Kansas, looks to be quite coachable … Aside from a poor final tournament game, seemed to be playing his best basketball as the season came to a close, including a huge 40 plus point breakout performance against West Virginia … 
","The biggest issue is whether or not Wiggins has the mental make up to maximize his immense physical gifts. While some scouts are extremely high on him, there are just as many that question his focus and passion for the game … Often plays too upright on offense, which can get him off his base and lead to turnovers … Needs to work on moving without the ball, has a reputation of sometimes standing, ball watching … Defensive awareness is something he must work on, along with always running out to his spot and not relying completely on length, athleticism to challenge a player … Still needs to add upper body strength, had issues finishing around the basket and getting knocked off of his spot when defensive rebounding … Long range shot is still not overly consistent, sometimes turns his hand outward on follow through … Often loose with dribble, sometimes has the ball too high and gets exploited when double teamed … Some question his lack of assertiveness offensively, which calls into question his ability to be a primary option on a high level team … Battled inconsistency and struggled against physical defense, which could point to strength as well as a sign of shaky confidence … Should look to become a more vocal leader … Too often settled for long range shots and did not venture out of his comfort zone enough, still has many things to learn in terms of creating mid range shots and counter moves … Had a difficult time establishing post position, something that could be a crucial next step to utilize his quickness and size as a wing at the next level … Has been compared to Kobe Bryant, but the biggest difference appears to be the attention to detail.

","Cliff’s biggest weakness is his lack of an offensive repertoire … His jump shot is many reps away from being what I would consider game ready, and despite having good footwork on his drop step, his more advanced footwork in the post is still coming along at this phase of his development … Alexander has also struggled to shoot over length, and when going straight into his defender, he’s often gotten his shot blocked … He was late to the game having started his basketball career while in high school, so there are missing, small, feel for the game instincts that show at times … Mostly a garbage man, and lob finisher on offense, he can often be predictable when trying to create for himself in 1 on 1 post up opportunities … Cliff is also a guy who with more continued training could become more athletic … As a college freshman, he’s strong, mobile, and good end to end, but his lateral quickness and pure leaping ability could use some continued focus … 
Overall: Cliff’s nose for the ball, and physicality on both ends of the court will most certainly help him carve out a role at the next level. Being just of adequate or average size for an NBA power forward, and not possessing a very advanced offensive game limits his potential, but Cliff projects to be a good rebounder, weak side shot blocker, and energy man when looking at his next level projection … Having one or two sure fire areas he can excel at in the NBA again is a big plus … Continued work on his offensive game, especially his creativity in the post and face up game will help his cause, and as he matures he has the frame to be a really, really physically strong player …

He does an excellent job of spotting up in transition as he has a knack for finding open spaces on the court to get his shot off, where he has deep range that should translate to the NBA arc … He gets his feet set quickly as well, and his mechanics stay consistent with a hand in his face … Dorsey also does a great job of running off screens to get his shot off and looks very comfortable shooting on the move … Off the pick and roll he consistently demonstrated the ability to make defenders pay for going under the ball screen with his pull up jumper … One also has to appreciate that he never loses confidence in his shot and that he does not need much space at all to get it off … At the rim, he uses a lot of shot fakes and has excellent footwork to get his shot off, or draw contact and get to the free throw line (75% conversion rate) … It is primarily Dorsey’s shot making and ability to get hot in a hurry that gives him great potential as a role player in the NBA … With NBA spacing he could thrive as a shot maker and secondary ball handler off the bench. Dorsey is not a true floor general, but he did play a lot of point guard for Oregon, so he has experience running an offense … He is also improving as a playmaker, as he has decent vision and does not turn the ball over that frequently … He operates well out of the pick and roll and has shown flashes of making good reads to set up his teammates … Dorsey particularly showed during the NCAA Tournament that he is unusually poised in big moments and that he can be depended on to make big plays when it counts … Any potential playoff team that may draft him would really appreciate the mental aspect of his game … If Dorsey can prove that the NCAA Tournament was not a fluke and that he is really beginning to put it all together, he could carve out a nice career for himself. 
","The most concerning aspect of Dorsey’s game is his less than impressive physical tools for an NBA two-guard … He checked in at the NBA Combine at 6-4.5 with an even more underwhelming 6-5 wingspan … He also weighs just 183 pounds, so he may struggle to get to the rim and finish against bigger, physical guards … This will likely prevent him from being a multi-positional defender at the next level … His lack of length will limit his effectiveness to guard on the perimeter and be active in passing lanes … He has already shown limitations in this area, averaging just 1.1 steals per 40 minutes in two seasons at Oregon … With his physical profile, he is probably best suited to guard point guards, but he may not be quick enough to do so given how explosive modern-day NBA point guards are … Dorsey also does not show a great deal of competitiveness on this end of the court either … When switched onto bigger players he does not battle for position persistently … He also tends to have some frequent lapses off the ball, losing shooters on the wings or giving up easy backdoor cuts. Dorsey does not project as an advanced shot creator at the NBA level either. Given his average explosiveness and shiftiness with the ball, he can get forced into some difficult shots, and he will probably have trouble finishing around the rim against NBA length/athleticism. Much of his shot selection comes via difficult contested shots given his lack of creativity with the ball and his less than ideal physical tools. He can be out of control going to the rim as well and force a lot of wild shots at the basket instead of looking to make a play for someone else. Dorsey is not a very willing passer either, which can cause him to be inefficient at times. It appears that the majority of his NBA impact will be contingent on his shot making ability. However, if he can’t get hot from the outside, NBA teams might worry if there is anything else he can bring to the table.

",4/1/16,"Already an intriguing prospect, Cousins has shown even more versatility as a senior since sliding over to the point guard position for Oklahoma … Despite not playing the point since high school, Cousins has shown a good grasp of running a pick and roll, as well as setting up one of the premier scorers in the country … He’s dishing out a career high 4.6 assists and doing so with a 2.0 assist to turnover ratio … His A/TO ratio actually increased dramatically since transitioning from an off ball player … In Lon Kruger’s high tempo offense, he’s grown used to pushing the ball, which will suit him better in the NBA than many slower paced college offenses … He’s shown the ability to get into the lane and make good decisions whether it’s finishing with a floater, getting to the hoop, or kicking it out to a teammate on the perimeter … Cousins has a good fundamental understanding of how to run an offense, and is versatile enough to be perceived as a threat off the drive and on the perimeter … Speaking of the perimeter, Isaiah is also a very capable long range shooter who’s hit 125-260 thee pointers in his junior and senior seasons in Norman combined (43%). That kind of volume and consistency will serve him well at the next level … As an NBA combo guard, who will most likely line up at the PG spot, Isaiah has a 6’5.5’’ wingspan and sizes up at 6’3’’ in shoes … While quite undersized for a two, his senior year showcasing his skills at the point has opened up more possibilities for him at the next level … For an NBA point guard he’s slightly above average in terms of size … This also allows him to rebound well for a player of his stature (4.6 per game).
","Isaiah can sometimes struggle in terms of shot selection, especially when creating for himself off the dribble … Going into Oklahoma’s Final 4 matchup versus Villanova, Cousins is shooting just .413% from the field, which is actually below his 3 point clip … A shaky shot selection, and tendencies to over penetrate and take a bad shot over length are a part of this issue … He’s also a surprisingly sub par free throw shooter (67%) … While a pretty well built 195 pounds, he could stand to gain some more strength to adapt defensively in the NBA … He has the size, and athletic ability to guard the point guard position, but continued work in the weight room will be a must … 
Overall: Isaiah Cousins is a combo guard capable of running the point in the NBA and hitting outside shots. He’s a little wild at times creating for himself in one on one matchups, but he’s also a solid pick and roll player with a respectable assist to turnover ratio and experience running in an up tempo system … Defensively he’s above average, but not exciting which is also representative of his athletic ability. Overall, while not a particularly high ceiling player, Cousins is capable of carving out a role for himself as a backup guard with his long range shooting a potential calling card.

","The biggest area of concern for Leaf at this point is his lack of strength … He needs to add leg and core strength to better absorb contact and maintain balance … The good news is that he is only 19 years old and that there’s plenty of time for his frame to fill out … However, this hurts his ability to defend in the post where he can sometimes get pushed around … Although he is a capable finisher at the rim, he also struggles to finish through contact and does not have great body control when attacking the basket … As skilled as he is, rarely does he finish around the basket with his left hand … Leaf will need to improve in this area at the next level, or it will be much more difficult for him to score consistently … Right now he projects as more of a stretch four than a reliable go to option on the block … Leaf also doesn’t have great length and doesn’t really project as a rim protector at the next level … Although he has good instincts, he struggles defensively at times with longer and more athletic forwards …

",5/24/18,"Brunson is one of the most accomplished/successful guards to come out of college basketball in recent memory … This past season as a junior, he won his second national championship, earned AP Player of the Year honors and the Wooden Award … Brunson started 115 games at one of the top college programs in the country in Villanova and is an NBA-ready guard with great maturity and basketball IQ for the point guard spot … He was highly productive in his final season, averaging 18.9 points and 4.6 assists as a junior while shooting 52.1 percent from the field and 40.8 percent from the three-point line … There are very few questions about Brunson’s leadership/ intensity / and pure basketball skills … He is an outstanding leader on the court and makes everyone around him better … Brunson can score at all three levels and be a quality facilitator of the basketball as well … While lacking elite size and explosiveness for an NBA lead guard, Brunson has the skill and craftiness to somewhat make up for it … He has the full arsenal of moves on offense … He is left-handed, which is already more difficult to guard in and of itself because defenders aren’t as used to guarding them … Brunson also moves without the ball very well and cuts with purpose to look for angles where he might be open to catch a pass in open areas … He is excellent at advancing the ball with a sense of urgency to spark the break … He consistently has his head up early in the backcourt and is willing to skip the ball ahead to the open man in transition … Brunson also has a very strong fundamental game on the defensive end … His footwork is very good … He understands how to use his body … He is willing to play with physicality … He anticipates, sees the floor and understands how to play in the team defensive concept … With all of that said, Brunson will still have to prove that he can keep NBA point guards in front of him … He also protects the ball by shielding it with his body and by using his strength … Brunson plays with a steady pace, changes gears and directions very well and creates space by initiating contact, all of which helps when penetrating the defense to score or kick to an open teammate … He has very good court vision and the instincts to see and deliver pinpoint cross-court passes or cunning bounce passes to open cutters … Brunson’s strength and decisiveness allows him to finish effectively around the rim, too, and he makes use of jab-steps and pump-fakes regularly, often times making strong and creative drives to the rim while staying low to the ground before taking off and finishing the play when he’s created the right angle … Brunson is comfortable finishing with either hand and is crafty in transition … He regularly utilizes Euro-steps and other advanced footwork moves while attacking from smart angles to get a high percentage shot off …
","The defensive end is where the most questions will arise for Brunson … In today’s NBA, most teams prefer to play lineups that are extremely versatile and switchable on the defensive end … It is far too easy for teams to force switches and get the match-ups they want … Brunson could be a liability in this regard if things go poorly … To be even more clear, Brunson projects as a player who can only defend one position, the point guard position, and it is not 100 percent clear that Brunson would be successful defending starting NBA point guards … The fact is that most players Brunson defends, even without getting switched on to wings or bigs, will be both bigger (longer) and faster than Brunson … While Brunson is an unselfish player, he has a tendency to at times over-dribble while probing the defense, which leads to turnovers … If he can develop a more consistent floater and pull-up mid-range jumper it would help to make decision making simpler while opening up angles to the rim while making him a more versatile scorer … The defensive end is where Brunson must make strides to prove to scouts that he hs what it takes to excel in the NBA … Brunson’s lateral quickness, effort, and willingness to contest shots left a lot to be desired, which is concerning considering his relative pedestrian physical tools … When projecting to the next level it’s necessary for Brunson’s stock that he proves to be a capable defender since he’ll have to stay in front of the best playmakers in the world at the NBA level …
